## Context

This is the foundational GTM 3.0 talk. Adam Gross (former CEO of Heroku and Vimeo, Salesforce veteran) lays out the framework for building self-serve go-to-market motions. While some AI-specific commentary feels dated (2020 margins vs. 2026 AI margins), the core framework is timeless.

## Highlights & Notes

### The GTM 3.0 Framework

> What's new is what I call go-to-market 3.0. That's what's obviously emerged in the past 10 years. That's the context in which true self-serve exists. Instead of selling to the department first and then selling to the enterprise, we're going to start with getting adoption for product at the individual level, then migrate up to the team via self-serve online motion, and then ultimately have an enterprise motion on top of that.

**My take:** This is a brilliant concept. The idea of individual to team play to enterprise play is so intuitive and totally fits the PLG motion.

---

> I'll just add one caveat before I launch in. I'm a huge advocate of self-serve. With two caveats. One, in the long-run, it only works when it's paired with enterprise. I by no means hope to advocate self-serve at the exclusion of enterprise. It's essential that they go together, and that there are exceptions. It's not for everybody. It's not the only path. But for most companies, especially developer and infrastructure companies, it is the path.

**My take:** I like and align with the idea of building up a very effective self-serve or PLG path that then matures into an enterprise sales motion. I like the idea that they work well together, but enterprise gets added in the longer time horizon after self-serve has been proven out.

---

> I think there's just a couple things to highlight there. One is, at the end the day, building self-service is a systems problem. It's the kind of problem that hasn't been solved. It's metrics oriented, it's process oriented, it's more of a machine, and founders are drawn to it. It's just a more satisfying problem space.

**My take:** This becomes especially appealing when AI can help build many of these things more efficiently with fewer people. It also self-selects a certain demographic.

---

> trend particularly for developer-facing companies

**My take:** Although his commentary applies directly and linearly to developer-facing companies who by and large self-serve and judge a company on its merits, I think more and more this is becoming the lay of the land with consumer-based and many B2B buyers as AI makes the ability to self-serve knowledge and do vetting process asymmetrically. So I think a lot of these trends are broader than just developer-facing companies in the current market some six years after this presentation was given.

### The Three Pillars: Free → Team → Enterprise

> The idea here is that there are really kind of three distinct but adjacent business that you're ultimately running. Now for today's talk, we're going to kind of leave out the enterprise piece, we're really just going to focus on team and self-serve. But it's helpful to think about these as again, kind of distinct channels that you have as you are migrating the user across them. You probably already know all that. What's really interesting is how predictable and repeatable the value proposition, the go-to-market motions, and the metrics are across these pillars.

---

> That's really where the helpful patterns emerge, as you think about what your self-serve business is. Kind of implicit in that is saying, the value and the value proposition of your product for a free individual user is going to be distinct and different from value proposition of your team user. So as opposed to thinking about self-service just to go-to-market motion, it really has to be holistic and has to be about a different value proposition. Then on top of that, it's going to have a different go-to-market motion and you're going to measure the market differently.

---

> So I'd argue that in a free product, the value proposition tends to align to creation.

**My take:** Absolutely. I want to try it. I want to get my hands on it. I want to see value as quickly as possible. Time to value.

---

> I'm an individual developer, I'm using Heroku, I'm deploying an app, life's good. I'm a individual using a tool like Figma. I'm creating the same kind of single user mode that I would be in for creating a UI. I'm having a great time. That is very distinct from the value proposition of collaboration, which is fundamentally, how as a team are we organizing our work around a shared process.

---

> So Heroku and single player mode versus Heroku and team mode, very distinct things. It's essential that you approach self-serve with that intentionality because you're ultimately going to be monetizing self-serve on that product. With free, what you're trying to do is drive adoption and engagement with team then with self-serve you're trying to take some percentage of that and convert it into ultimately what is typically a monthly MRR based business.

---

> So this has to start from a product-value orientation and the metrics are going to be different, and they're going to be predictably different in that almost always what you're measuring on 1 is engagement. And what you're measuring on 2 is MRR.

**My take:** This bit may change slightly as we have individual paid, relatively successful AI native companies. The basic premise is the same, but you might consider individual freemium versus individual paid versus team/collaboration versus enterprise. The fundamental patterning is still valuable even if the specifics might be changing in the current landscape.

---

> how you do that transition up from free to team and then ultimately from enterprise. What's most fascinating for me is looking at that nonlinear value proposition change as you go from free to team. When you have that, it's almost like there are two product-market fit or customer discovery cycles that need to happen.

**My take:** Considering this as two different product market fits, as well as having two different customer profiles, sets a relatively high bar that I think is appropriate and accurate for these different use cases.

---

> If you're just offering the same product, and this one has some modest differentiation from the free to team, you're going to have limited success in conversion. It has to be a distinct value proposition. I'll go back one slide to just say, for something on the enterprise side, what comes after that almost universally is compliance.

**My take (from the slide):**
1. Free / Individual — Value Prop: Creation, GTM Motion: Free/Adoption, Metrics: MAU
2. Team (self-serve) — Value Prop: Collaboration, GTM Motion: Self-serve, Metrics: MRR
3. Enterprise (C-level) — Value Prop: Compliance, GTM Motion: Enterprise, Metrics: ACV

### Anti-Patterns

> Are your customers coming from lead gen, 'white paper'-gated content capture which is a classic sales 2.0 motion? Or are they coming from you converting them from being engaged active users, to then some 'teams' product? They're entirely different businesses, entirely different motions, yet we tend not to be as intentional or as explicit as I think we should be.

**My take:** I like the concept of knowing the anti-patterns to delineate between what he calls sales 2.0 and sales 3.0.

---

> Another super common anti-pattern is a developer-facing company looking to build a self-serve business, hires a bunch of people with marketing in their title, but it turns out that they're classic sales 2.0 dimension people. So then what they start doing is buying ads and doing gated content you can capture, which is completely opposite of how the 3.0 model works. The 3.0 level model is about driving product adoption. 2.0 model is lead capture, trial, sell.

---

> The other thing I see happen as an anti-pattern is, companies really want to go to enterprise and they skip self-serve. What ends up happening is, you end up selling via enterprise channels, which is very expensive. Essentially, self-serve deals, let's just call them deals under $40-50k annually. When I look at enterprise sales at an organization and they're doing $20k transactions annually, those should be self-serve deals.

---

### Who Owns What?

> As an example, who's the primary marketing owner? Is it a traditional programs-oriented marketing owner? Or is it a PMM marketing owner? So, often where companies go sideways, and why I find this framework so helpful, is it's really hard for an organization to execute well, in any one of these pillars. If you don't have some way of keeping these things separate and rationalized, you're just going to have people running over each other all the time, and it's going to make a bad time even worse.

---

> As an example, one of the more interesting discussions is, who owns sales? Now sales here, in the free mode means, how are you driving adoption? Though not of course, it's most often a marketing function. As you get into team, there are a lot of different ways of slicing it.

---

> This is an area where I have a lot of different conversations with different startups. Sometimes that's done by marketing, which is to say, there aren't any reps at all. Sometimes you have an inside sales organization that's dedicated. That's how we did it at Heroku. Sometimes you have a support organization that, in addition to doing support, is effectively doing sales in that self-serve mode.

**My take:** I like the different models and formats for how to approach this question of who does sales in team mode.

---

> I will say I'm increasingly a fan of the idea of support again, especially for the products that we tend to work with as developer-facing companies, of having a combined support/sales organization for the self-serve tier.

**My take:** Makes sense for developer tools, but also more broadly, I like the idea that customer success is the sales motion. There's something really powerful about explicitly defining what value looks like and holding oneself accountable to value before and as the sales pitch process.

---

> At Heroku, we had a hybrid function where marketing owned the self-serve business, which was pretty substantial, over 100 million when I left. I've also seen models where product can own it.

**My take:** Interesting debate on whether product or marketing should own active user accounts and adoption. Hybrid makes sense in that way.

---

### Cross-Functional Structure

> One of the key things that I've tended to do is create standing monthly meetings, across sales, marketing and product. One for the free business, one for the self-serve business, one for the enterprise business, to give the clarity of allowing each of those cross functional teams to have a common set of priorities and backlog items within each one of those verticals. Because if you just have one product backlog for the company as opposed to having some view or lens that allows you to think about it based on a business line, it affects your ability to really prioritize. How do you begin to rationalize those priorities in a way that's coherent, high trust? You have to have lanes for these things operate.

**My take:** I love this idea of breaking out vertical teams within swim lanes based on which segment it's targeting.

---

### Support + Sales Integration

> As I mentioned, I'm a fan of, at least in the beginning, building integrated support and sales teams for self-serve. Because in my experience, the work that those people are doing, the account managers who manage self-serve, it's almost always technical and support in nature. So why not actually integrate those things and just have it be a support team that is oriented around talking, not only to existing customers, and this is the difference, but to prospective customers as well and helping get them through the buying process.

**My take:** This is a hugely interesting point for companies for whom self-serve is complicated, such as voice AI. This is why forward deployed engineers are such a common emerging pattern. And there is an argument to be made for FDEs to be the sales team until there is a significant critical threshold to pass into delineating the sales motion. Maybe only once we hit 3.0 and enterprise, but until then FDEs can and will be the sales force.

---

### When to Add Enterprise

> Typically what happens is, or at least what I've seen is, if you've built a freebie thing that's getting engagement and adoption, you've got a self-serve machine. If you crank that up to $10M ARR or somewhere in that ballpark, then you start doing some exploratory enterprise, probing, and selling. So typically you're not starting with a Head of Sales, you're starting with a sales rep who is going to be much more solution-oriented. Not your traditional kind of transactional or repetition kind of sales rep but one who's more comfortable with helping you as a CEO, who's helping your product teams, helping your marketing team.

---

> I wouldn't even begin thinking about it until your self-serve business is at about 10 million ARR. So don't worry about it too early. But if you're up past 30, and you haven't done it, then I would be pretty suspicious. Hopefully that's a helpful framing to help orient you and your teams around thinking about self-serve.

**My take:** Whether or not one agrees, this is an interesting tolerance band between 10 million and 30 million ARR to graduate from team mode to enterprise mode.

---

> Discover what that value proposition is because if you don't know what your enterprise proposition is, you're going to have to tease that out with your customers. When you're ready for 3.0, it isn't like, "boom, let's hire the head of X or a big fancy sales executive." By far the most common example is early days, you hire a sales exec, then you end up getting rid of them nine months later because the whole thing is burnt out and you had a bad time.

**My take:** Directly relevant to the conversation I had with Moen about starting with an AE first. I think the interesting question is how to define the value propositions along the three different steps and execute on those systematically.

---

### On Trials

> Trials are an interesting case. Again, it's not one size fits all. I think trials make sense if there's no individual value proposition for your products or there's very limited long term use for an individual. So if you've been doing trials and you want to add a self-serve component to that, I think that makes a lot of sense. I would think about just having the self-serve be the main offering in the trial for the enterprise. I tend to be skeptical of trials in 2.0 and 3.0 companies.

---

### Enterprise vs. Department Sales

> That said, I want to be very explicit about something. If you're selling to a department within an enterprise, that's totally fine. Enterprise sales is selling to the C suite with compliance features versus selling to the department with collaboration features. Those are my definitions. If you can get departmental customers, that is the key to your business, because those are the ones that are ultimately going to migrate up enterprise.

---

### On Heroku/GitHub Culture

> There was a kind of a consciousness at companies like Heroku and GitHub in the early days, that going all the way to enterprise was going to be anathema to the company values or goals, and would somehow corrupt everything that had made the company and product successful.
>
> I couldn't disagree with any of those statements more. If I see a business that's just done free and self-serve, and has resisted enterprise, I will see a business that is living up to only a fraction of its ultimate potential. So in the long run, self service isn't enough. You have to do the self-serve to enterprise transition as well while you're keeping all of those pillars healthy. That's the point. You're doing all three.

---

### Investor Perspective

> Speaking for myself, I'm not looking at the business as a function of the revenue, I'm looking as a function of the opportunity. Frankly if a Series A company came to me and said they closed a $100k deal, I would probably treat that with some suspicion because I would worry that they were over rotating to enterprise, which I think wouldn't be sustainable. I'd be much more interested in what their adoption is, which ultimately translates into potential for building self service.

---

### On AI Margins (Dated Take)

> That's more a function of the AI business than it is of the 1-2-3 model. Everything that I've come to understand about the AI business is, margins tend to be poor because it's so resource intensive. It tends to be very professional services heavy, which is implicitly a 3.0 business, not a 1.0 or 2.0 business. So, you know, there are exceptions. If you've got margin problems, you have value problems, and crafting value out of AI is super hard. That's just part of the space. It depends on what your definition of a good margin businesses is. Traditional SaaS businesses can operate at 20-30% and still have a good business. But there definitely are kind of yellow flags associated with the AI business in general.

**My take:** This feels hilariously dated today as AI margin businesses are walloping on margins.

### Contact Info

> Q&A — On the slide, he notes that his email is adam@adamcgross.com.

**My take:** Add this to his basecard/persona in case I ever want to reach out and thank Adam for this formative framework. Really deeply informs how I think about modern PLG GTM.
