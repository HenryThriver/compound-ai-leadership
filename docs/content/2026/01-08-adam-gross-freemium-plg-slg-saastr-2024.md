## Context

This is Adam Gross's updated GTM 3.0 talk at SaaStr 2024. It refines and modernizes the 2020 Heavybit framework with fresh examples and acknowledges we're entering "GTM 4.0" (AI era). More polished than the 2020 version, with clearer emphasis on operational excellence.

## Highlights & Notes

### Why PLG Matters

> So, why does everybody talk about PLG? This part you already know. I probably stole most of the stuff from SaaStr anyway, that if you do it right, you can have much more satisfying customer journeys results in much lower customer acquisition costs.

---

> If you do PLG right, it has some nice factors in terms of predictability.

---

> A reason why it's attractive to a lot of startups and a lot of startup founders is that it's an organization and operations problem. It isn't a relationship problem, so it's appealing to people who like building things, as opposed to people who like spending time at dinner talking about deals with people.

---

### PLG Is a Business Model, Not a Sales Motion

> It also points to one of the core punchlines, which is that PLG is not a sales motion. Go-to-market 3.0 is not a sales motion; it is a business model, it is a business architecture, and it is fundamental to your customer journey.

---

> So it turns out PLG, Go-to-Market 3.0 has a lot of these very kind of consistent shapes and characteristics, which is really helpful if you're thinking about building this motion into your business.

**My take:** I like this framing a lot and it makes good sense to me.

---

### Origins: Developer Marketing

> Right at the beginning, the first people we targeted with PLG were developers because they had both the technical ability and organizational autonomy to adopt tools and new technology inside of their organizations. So if you want to understand where PLG go-to-market kind of started and what's working, then developer marketing is always a good place to begin.

---

### The Key Metric Shift

> So the key measure becomes adoption, not conversion, not closing. Once we have that adoption, we convert to the department, and then we convert to ultimately the enterprise.

---

### Cross-Functional Squads

> So literally, the way I would run my business at Heroku or at Vimeo is I had a Free Squad, I had a self-served Squad, and I had an Enterprise Squad. Now, that's not exclusively it, but that's in terms of the cross-organizational piece.

---

> They had their own functional priorities, but they also met as a team

---

> So as complicated as all that sounds, a simple meeting where you have key stakeholders, for a free and team, it typically includes somebody from marketing, someone from product, and for enterprise, it kind of works how it does today. Typically, somebody from marketing, somebody from sales, and you can get a rational shared view of what the organization is doing to drive those businesses forward.

---

### Resource Allocation Across Pillars

> How do you have a rational and effective alignment across the organization so that it is consistently allocating its resources across those pillars in the same way? This is hard, and it's super important. Here's the good news: there's only one wrong answer. The wrong answer is a third, a third, a third, right? Because if you're just spreading resources across everything, you haven't made a decision.

---

### The Enterprise Mirage

> Those startups in the house, if you are doing one and two and you're thinking about adding Enterprise, and you're under 10 million in ARR, don't underestimate the cost and complexity of building everything you need for Enterprise. It's so alluring, right? Because those customers are right there, and your VC just introduced them to you. They're going to sign $100,000 if you only do X, Y, and Z. There's a little bit of what I call the Enterprise Mirage that startups often fall into because they can get this initial boost of Enterprise

---

### Operational Excellence Is Paramount

> One thing I will implore you is in the 3.0 world, operational excellence becomes paramount. If you think about the go-to-market motions from one to three, one is really kind of consumer oriented. It feels a little more B2C. It's high transaction volume, it's very programmatic, online, and automated marketing, versus right all the way to three, which is back in the golf course. In order to do one well, and in order to connect one all the way up to three, you need to be excellent at your customer data systems. I say this as a CRM nerd.

---

> So, operational excellence, proficiency in sales ops, rev ops — all these pieces, operational data warehousing, your customer data platforms — all this stuff just gains more and more relevance in this new world.

**My take:** Aligned with what I'm reading in Ignite.

---

### GTM 4.0

> We are definitely starting the GTM 4.0 era.

## POG Notes

**POG-worthy:** Yes (combined with 2020 talk)
**Audience:** Same as 2020 talk - more polished, better for time-constrained folks
**My angle:** The "Enterprise Mirage" framing is especially useful for founders being pushed by VCs toward premature enterprise sales.
