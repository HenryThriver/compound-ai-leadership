## Context

SaaStr's written summary of Adam Gross's GTM 3.0 framework. More digestible than the full talks, with clear formatting. Good for quick reference.

## Highlights & Notes

### Who Is Adam Gross

> Adam Gross, former CEO of Vimeo and Heroku and veteran of Salesforce and Dropbox

---

### GTM Evolution

> - GTM 1.0: The "Golf Course Era" – Selling to CIOs over lunch
> - GTM 2.0: The "SaaS Era" – Online trials, SEM/SEO, inside sales
> - GTM 3.0: The "PLG Era" – User-first, experience-driven, bottom-up adoption

---

### PLG Is Business Architecture

> But here's the real kicker: PLG isn't just another sales motion. It's a fundamental business architecture that requires rethinking your entire customer journey.

**My take:** Good reframe into more common/modern nomenclature for what Adam was mentioning.

### The Three Tiers

> - Free Tier (Measured by Monthly Active Users)
>     - Focus: Creation value prop
>     - Example: Single-user mode in Dropbox
>     - Key Metric: Adoption
> - Team Tier (Measured by MRR)
>     - Focus: Collaboration features
>     - Example: Shared folders, team workflows
>     - Key Metric: Monthly recurring revenue
> - Enterprise Tier (Measured by ACV)
>     - Focus: Compliance and security
>     - Example: SSO, audit logs, enterprise SLAs
>     - Key Metric: Annual contract value

---

### Enterprise Warning

> Here's a controversial but important take: If you're under $10M ARR, stay away from Enterprise.

---

> Why? Because too many startups fall into what Gross calls the "Enterprise Mirage" – landing a few big logos through heroic efforts but failing to build repeatable systems. The infrastructure cost for real Enterprise readiness is massive. Wait until you have the resources to do it right.

---

### Operational Requirements

> Want to know what separates the winners from the also-rans in GTM 3.0? It's not just product or sales – it's operational excellence.
>
> The requirements:
> - Rock-solid customer data systems
> - Sophisticated sales ops and revops
> - Advanced operational data warehousing
> - Modern customer data platforms
>
> And here's the part that might surprise you: This needs to be a CEO-level priority. Your customer schema is as important as your product roadmap.

---

### PLG Requires Transformation

> The companies that fail at PLG usually try to treat it as an add-on feature rather than a fundamental business transformation.

---

### Squad Playbook

> Want to make this work? Here's your playbook:
>
> 1. Create squad teams around each pillar (Free, Team, Enterprise)
> 2. Include cross-functional representatives in each squad
> 3. Sync priorities quarterly while maintaining functional autonomy
> 4. Implement common reporting frameworks
> 5. Hold regular stakeholder meetings to maintain alignment

---

## Extracted Insights

1. **GTM 1.0 → 2.0 → 3.0 evolution** — Golf course → SaaS trials → PLG user-first
2. **Free = Creation, Team = Collaboration, Enterprise = Compliance** — Distinct value props
3. **$10M ARR threshold for enterprise** — Below that, stay focused on self-serve
4. **Customer data systems = CEO priority** — Schema as important as product roadmap
5. **PLG fails when treated as add-on** — Must be fundamental transformation
6. **Squad playbook** — Cross-functional teams per pillar, quarterly sync, common reporting

---

## POG Notes

**POG-worthy:** Yes (best for quick sharing - more digestible than videos)
**Audience:** Time-constrained execs who won't watch a 45-min video
**My angle:** The squad playbook is immediately actionable. The "$10M rule" is quotable.
