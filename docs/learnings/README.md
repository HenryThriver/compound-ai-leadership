# Key Learnings

> Do not make the same mistake twice. First occurrence: learning. Second: systemic failure.

This directory captures mistakes, failures, and hard-won insights. Each entry represents something we now know that we didn't before—and a system in place to prevent repetition.

## How to Add a Learning

When something goes wrong or you discover a blind spot:

1. Create a new file: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-slug.md`
2. Use the template below
3. Ensure the prevention mechanism is concrete and verifiable
4. Link to any updated checklists, values, or agents
