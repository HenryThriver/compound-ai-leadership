## Dimensions

### 1. Team Quality (Weight: HIGH - possibly most important)
*Can I learn from these people? Are they smart, fun to work with?*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Exceptional team - people I'd actively seek to learn from, genuinely enjoyable |
| 4 | Strong team - clearly smart, good energy, would learn a lot |
| 3 | Solid team - competent, nothing concerning |
| 2 | Mediocre - wouldn't learn much, just a job |
| 1 | Red flags - difficult people, toxic dynamics |

*How to assess: LinkedIn profiles of leadership, Glassdoor, backchannel, interview conversations*

### 2. Growth Metrics (Weight: HIGH)
*Is this a rocket ship? Growth matters more than stage.*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | 5x-10x revenue growth trajectory; clear rocket ship |
| 4 | Strong growth (3x+), Series B/C with momentum |
| 3 | Solid growth, Series B/C, proven PMF |
| 2 | Slow growth or early stage without exceptional metrics |
| 1 | Stagnant, declining, or pre-PMF without traction |

*Note: Series A acceptable if growth is 5x-10x. Otherwise target B/C for career progression (Seed → A → B trajectory).*

## Quick Filters (before full scorecard)

Before investing time in full analysis, check:

1. **Team Quality signal** - Any LinkedIn/backchannel intel on leadership?
2. **Growth signal** - Any public metrics, funding news, hiring velocity?
3. **Role exists** - Are they actually hiring for this function?

If any of these are red flags, may not be worth full scorecard.

*Note: Scores are guidelines. A single disqualifying dimension (score of 1 on HIGH-weight item) may override total score. Team Quality is the tie-breaker.*
