# Company Evaluation Framework

Two-phase evaluation: **Screen** (pre-conversation) → **Evaluate** (interview stage).

---

# PHASE 1: Pre-Conversation Screening

*"Is it worth my time to spin this up?"*

**Data sources:** LinkedIn, Crunchbase, news, website, job postings, light backchannel

## Quick Screen Checklist

| Signal | Source | Pass/Fail |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Growth signal** | Funding news, hiring velocity, headcount growth | |
| **Team quality signal** | Leadership LinkedIn profiles, backgrounds | |
| **Role exists** | Job postings, org structure | |
| **Industry fit** | Company description | |
| **AI-native surface signals** | Website messaging, tech stack mentions | |

**Decision:** [ ] Proceed to conversation | [ ] Pass | [ ] Watch list

# PHASE 2: Interview-Stage Evaluation

*"How excited am I? Is this team set up for success?"*

**Data sources:** Interviews, backchannels, insider conversations, detailed research

## Scoring Guide

**5** = Exceptional fit
**4** = Strong fit
**3** = Acceptable
**2** = Weak fit
**1** = Disqualifying

## Dimensions

### 1. Team Quality (Weight: HIGH - possibly most important)
*Can I learn from these people? Are they smart, fun to work with?*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Exceptional team - people I'd actively seek to learn from, genuinely enjoyable |
| 4 | Strong team - clearly smart, good energy, would learn a lot |
| 3 | Solid team - competent, nothing concerning |
| 2 | Mediocre - wouldn't learn much, just a job |
| 1 | Red flags - difficult people, toxic dynamics |

*How to assess: LinkedIn profiles of leadership, Glassdoor, backchannel, interview conversations*

### 2. Growth Metrics (Weight: HIGH)
*Is this a rocket ship? Growth matters more than stage.*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | 5x-10x revenue growth trajectory; clear rocket ship |
| 4 | Strong growth (3x+), Series B/C with momentum |
| 3 | Solid growth, Series B/C, proven PMF |
| 2 | Slow growth or early stage without exceptional metrics |
| 1 | Stagnant, declining, or pre-PMF without traction |

*Note: Series A acceptable if growth is 5x-10x. Otherwise target B/C for career progression (Seed → A → B trajectory).*

### 3. Industry Fit (Weight: MEDIUM - nice to have)
*Does this align with where I want to build expertise?*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Healthcare Voice AI (meaningful work bonus) |
| 4 | Logistics, Customer Support, Home Services |
| 3 | Adjacent/interesting vertical |
| 2 | HR/Recruiting |
| 1 | Sales coaching or uninteresting vertical |

### 4. Role Scope (Weight: HIGH)
*Strategic influence, not just execution?*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | VP/CRO level, GTM + AI strategy ownership |
| 4 | Director with clear path to strategic influence |
| 3 | Senior IC with broad scope |
| 2 | Tactical execution role |
| 1 | No strategic component |

### 5. AI-Native GTM (Weight: HIGH)
*Is AI central to GTM, not an afterthought?*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | AI-first GTM; building the future of revenue |
| 4 | Heavy AI investment, central to strategy |
| 3 | AI-curious, early adoption |
| 2 | Traditional GTM with some automation |
| 1 | Skeptical of AI in GTM |

#### AI Organizational Readiness (Discovery Questions)
*Source: Ignite book - use in interviews and backchannels*

**Leadership Commitment Indicators:**
- [ ] Senior leaders use AI tools personally (not just reviewing reports)
- [ ] Leadership meetings discuss AI capability development (not just procurement)
- [ ] Budget prioritizes data infrastructure + capability building over tool acquisition
- [ ] Performance metrics include AI workflow adoption + business impact (not just utilization)

**Technical Infrastructure Prerequisites:**
- [ ] Core systems have APIs enabling data sharing between platforms
- [ ] Data quality supports automated decision-making (80%+ accuracy threshold)
- [ ] IT can implement integrations without extensive consulting/vendor PS
- [ ] InfoSec policies accommodate AI while maintaining data protection

**Cultural Readiness Signals:**
- [ ] Teams willing to experiment (not demanding perfect solutions immediately)
- [ ] Employee feedback focuses on business outcomes (not tool preferences)
- [ ] Management emphasizes learning/iteration (not blame when AI experiments fail)
- [ ] Cross-functional collaboration exists for data-intensive projects

**Failure Anti-Patterns (Red Flags):**
1. **Tool-First Implementation** - Bought impressive AI tools without deeper strategy
2. **Delegation Without Understanding** - Leaders assigned AI to tech/ops without personal AI literacy
3. **Perfectionism Paralysis** - Delaying until perfect infrastructure (rare)
4. **Scope Creep & Complexity Accumulation** - Initial wins → rapid expansion → complexity outpaces capability

### 6. Culture (Weight: MEDIUM)
*Experimentation, data-driven, C-suite partnership?*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Experimentation culture, data-driven, strong C-suite partnership |
| 4 | Good culture, open to new approaches |
| 3 | Standard startup culture |
| 2 | Traditional/hierarchical |
| 1 | Red flags in culture |

*Note: Team Quality is now separate - this is about the broader org culture.*

### 7. Compensation Potential (Weight: MEDIUM)
*Appropriate for top 1% performers?*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Top-tier comp, meaningful equity |
| 4 | Competitive comp, good equity |
| 3 | Market rate |
| 2 | Below market |
| 1 | Significantly below market |

### 8. Timing & Urgency (Weight: VARIABLE)
*Are they hiring now? Does timing work?*

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Active search, immediate need |
| 4 | Building team this quarter |
| 3 | Planning to hire in 3-6 months |
| 2 | No current plans but open |
| 1 | Not hiring / bad timing |
