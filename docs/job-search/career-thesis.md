## The Thesis

**I build AI-powered revenue systems that scale efficiently from $10M to $100M ARR.**

First-principles AI strategy that aligns **people > process > technology**, with hands-on expertise in deploying AI agents at scale and managing hybrid human-AI teams.

## What I'm Looking For

### Role Type
- RevOps leadership OR Transformational AI leadership
- Strategic influence over GTM strategy and AI/automation roadmaps
- Executive partnership with C-suite access
- NOT purely tactical execution roles

### Company Profile (Ideal)

| Dimension | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Stage** | Series B/C | Proven PMF, scaling phase |
| **Revenue** | $10M+ ARR | Rapid MoM growth |
| **GTM Approach** | AI-native | Not bolted-on automation |
| **Culture** | Experimentation + data-driven | Willing to try new things |
| **Trajectory** | High-growth | Ambitious revenue targets |

### What Won't Work

- Pre-Series B without rapid growth metrics
- Traditional sales orgs disinterested in AI/automation
- C-suite skeptical about RevOps' strategic value
- Purely tactical roles lacking strategic partnership

## Industry Preferences (Voice AI Focus)

Based on current interest and market opportunity:

| Industry | Interest Level | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| **Healthcare** | Highest | Would love to pivot; meaningful work + growing market |
| **Logistics** | Medium | Natural progression from CloudTrucks, but not in love |
| **Customer Support** | Medium | Where Voice AI started; lots of players (Sierra, Decagon) |
| **Home Services** | Medium | Growing space (Avoca, Netic) |
| **HR/Recruiting** | Low | Less interesting personally |
| **Sales Coaching** | Low | Not interesting industry-wise |

## Evaluation Framework

When assessing opportunities, weight these dimensions:

1. **Industry Fit** - Does this align with where I want to build expertise?
2. **Stage Fit** - Series B/C with proven PMF?
3. **Role Scope** - Strategic influence, not just execution?
4. **AI-Native** - Is AI central to GTM, not an afterthought?
5. **Culture** - Experimentation, data-driven, C-suite partnership?
6. **Comp** - Appropriate for top 1% performers?

## Long-Term Horizon

> Just because an introduction happens now doesn't mean a job offer happens now.

Some relationships will yield opportunities in 3-24 months. Prioritize based on fit, but cultivate relationships regardless of immediate timing. Things change fast at startups.

---

## Open Questions

- How much do I weight "meaningful work" (healthcare) vs "natural progression" (logistics)?
- What's my floor on company stage? Would I do Series A if growth metrics were exceptional?
- How do I think about founder quality as a scoring dimension?

*This thesis should evolve as I learn more about the market and myself.*
