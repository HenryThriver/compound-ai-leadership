## Open Questions

### Format
- [ ] Reading group vs. study group vs. discussion series?
- [ ] Live sessions or async?
- [ ] Frequency? (weekly, bi-weekly, one-time)
- [ ] Who facilitates?

### Participation Requirements
- [ ] **Do participants need to have read the book?**
  - Kim hasn't read it yet
  - Could be "read along" format vs. "already read" discussion
  - Consider: reading together might build stronger bonds

### My Role
- [ ] Am I co-organizing with Coach K or just participating?
- [ ] Should I reach out to Coach K to coordinate?
- [ ] Opportunity to lead/facilitate some sessions?

### Logistics
- [ ] Platform (Zoom, in-person SF, hybrid?)
- [ ] Scheduling across time zones
- [ ] Slack/Discord for async discussion?

---

## Action Items

### Before February
- [ ] Finish reading Ignite
- [ ] Write book review with questions (promised to Joseph)
- [ ] Reach out to Coach K about his February plans
- [ ] Decide on participation requirements
- [ ] Scrape LinkedIn profiles for all participants

### When Launching
- [ ] Coordinate with Coach K on format
- [ ] Send invites to interested folks
- [ ] Set up communication channel

## Why This Matters

This is a natural community-building opportunity:
- All GTM/AI-interested people
- Shared context (the book)
- Low-lift way to deepen multiple RQ0→RQ1→RQ2 relationships
- Potential to become ongoing peer group
