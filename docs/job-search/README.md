# Job Search (2026)

Infrastructure for systematic job search. Testing ground for CultivateHQ workflows.

## Quick Start

**Every session, check:** [NEXT_ACTIONS.md](NEXT_ACTIONS.md)

## Structure

```
job-search/
├── NEXT_ACTIONS.md      # Active task list (check first!)
├── career-thesis.md     # What I'm optimizing for
├── company-scorecard.md # Template for evaluating fit
├── industry-landscape.md # Voice AI market map
└── companies/
    └── [company].md     # Individual company profiles
```

## Current Focus

**Target Space:** Voice AI
- Healthcare (most interesting)
- Logistics (natural progression)
- Customer Support (where Voice AI started)
- Home Services

**Target Roles:** CRO, VP RevOps, GTM leadership

**Methodology:** LAMP (List, Alumni, Motivation, Posting) + relationship-first approach

## Key Insight

> Just because an introduction happens now doesn't mean a job offer happens now.
> It might be the start of a 3-24 month relationship that yields the perfect opportunity when timing aligns.

Prioritize based on company fit, but cultivate relationships regardless of immediate opportunity.

## Integration

- **Contacts** live in `docs/relationships/contacts/cro-revops/`
- **Open loops** tracked in `docs/relationships/loops/open.md`
- **Company research** informs contact prioritization

*This system compounds. Every company researched, every relationship cultivated feeds future opportunities.*
