# POG Content Index

Curated content worth sharing, with your take on each piece.

> **POG** = Piece of Generosity — content shared to add value, not to take.

---

## How This Works

1. Content marked "POG-worthy" during ingestion lands here
2. Each entry has your angle/take on the content
3. When meeting someone new, cross-reference their interests to find relevant POGs
4. Track what you've shared with whom in `shared/`
