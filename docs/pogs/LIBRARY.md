# Shareable Content Library

Curated content worth sharing, with your take on each piece.

> **POG** = Piece of Generosity — the act of sharing content to add value, not to take.

This is the **reservoir** of POG-worthy content. The same piece can become many POGs when shared with different people.

---

## How This Works

1. Content marked "POG-worthy" during ingestion lands here
2. Each entry has your angle/take on the content
3. When meeting someone new, cross-reference their interests to find relevant content
4. When you share, log the POG in `sent/LOG.md`
5. When someone shares with you, log in `received/LOG.md`
6. Track reciprocity: POGs sent :: POGs received
