Enter the internet and the revolutionary technology of 3D printing, and hey presto, made-to-measure footwear is now available to a mass market. Vancouver-based Wiivv Wearables begin the process with an award-winning smartphone app, which gathers the customer's data and then generates a biomechanically optimized design. This is then 3D printed, assembled, and shipped to the customer within 14 days. Over 12 million data points were used to create the Wiivv Fit algorithm, and Wiivv’s proprietary technologies have reduced the cost of 3D printing by 98.5%.
