At Bridgewater, they implemented a true meritocracy: people were ranked based on their demonstrated expertise in a given domain, and the weight of their opinions on that topic was adjusted accordingly.\n\nMost organizations operate under an authoritarian model. The drawbacks are obvious. Others swing toward democracy, which is an improvement — but often inefficient.\n\nWhich raises an interesting question:\n What if social platforms incorporated some form of expertise weighting — so that thoughtful, informed voices were amplified over the loudest or angriest ones?\n\nIs that unrealistic? Or is it exactly what’s missing?",

If there’s one theme that’s impossible to miss, it’s this: your network—used intentionally and generously—is one of the biggest levers you have.\n\nAs Derek Sivers puts it, if knowledge alone were enough, we’d all be millionaires with six-pack abs. Execution is the differentiator.\n\nOne of the simplest ways to execute better is to build a system for tracking your outreach and holding yourself accountable. That can be something like Clay (a fantastic company and team) or just a well-organized spreadsheet. Make a list of the people you want to reconnect with, track the touchpoints, and score the strength of the relationship. And—something I repeat often—if it’s not in your calendar, the odds that it happens are close to zero. Block 1–2 small windows each week.\n\nIf you want next-level structure and more strategies, take a look at Beyond Connections. It’s been one of the most valuable investments I’ve made in my career. https://lnkd.in/geuDH5Uf",

Usually, it’s a mix of all of the above.\n\nBut lately, as I’ve been exploring how to operate at my highest level, I’ve started adding one more ingredient to the mix: inspiration.\n\nI didn’t expect this to be a missing piece. I’ve spent years in personal development programs, sales training, and GTM strategy work — and somehow I still overlooked how much energy the right idea or phrase can generate.

It took me longer than I wish to realize that this skill — the ability to address something difficult with clarity and respect — is a genuine superpower. And once you develop it, it changes everything. Not just professionally, but in your personal relationships as well.\n\nI was reminded of this today while sharing some concerns with someone on my team. I was struck by how thoughtfully they listened — asking questions, seeking to understand, and taking real ownership. I did my best to speak only from my own experience, acknowledge the limits of my perception, and leave room for context I might not have.\n\nWhen both people handle these moments well, the trust and respect that follows is profound. These conversations deepen relationships, not damage them.\n\nAnd here’s to hoping this is one uniquely human skill that AI never quite learns.",

Like any skill, it can be learned — and those who lean in and build it intentionally are the ones who will see real dividends.\n\nAt the heart of any effective job search is networking — though I prefer to reframe it as relationship building. (That reframe comes from Connected Success, which has been incredibly valuable to me.)\n\nAnother reframe: approach this process — and really, every interaction — with generosity. When your outreach is centered on the other person and focused on reconnecting, helping, or simply showing genuine interest, it becomes not just more effective, but more enjoyable.\n\n And when you enjoy it, you’ll do it more — and that’s where the magic happens.\nThe people you already know and have worked with are your greatest resource right now. Reach out. Offer to help. Co-elevate each other.\n\nNone of us can do this alone — so don’t try.\n\n And if I know you and can be of help, drop me a DM.",

That’s sales.\n\nI’m a big believer in ethical selling — influencing in service of what’s best for others.\n\nIn that parenting example, your intent is good: you want what’s best for your kiddo. They know that — and that’s what makes your “pitch” land.\n\nThe same principle applies in business. My goal in every sales engagement is to be the most assertive, polite, and respectful person my prospect has ever met. \n\nOver time, they come to see that their success is my goal — because ultimately, my success is tied to theirs.",

I've been in the GoToMarket space my entire career and I've seen this strategy work consistently. \n\nWhen approaching a prospective new customer, you have to earn the right to sell to them. You do that by being generous. Be generous with the industry and product knowledge you have. You can also do it with your relationships (pro tip....take Keith's Beyond Connections course and learn how to run community dinners that deepen relationships). \n\nAll good relationships are based on trust and respect. The more generous you are, the more of each you will earn. \n\nThanks for lighting the way Keith Ferrazzi",

Most of us have been there at one point or another.\n\nOne piece of advice I often share — especially with people not in sales — is this: reframe your job search as selling yourself.\n\nHaving worked with many job seekers (both formally and informally), one of the biggest challenges I see is how uncomfortable people are with the idea of “selling” themselves. It’s understandable. But that mental shift — from job seeker to trusted advisor presenting value — can be a real unlock.\n\nYes, there are bad actors out there who give sales a bad name. But there’s also a way to approach sales that’s ethical, authentic, and doesn’t feel icky.\n\nIn my own work, I always anchor on one thing: the value my product or solution delivers to customers. The same principle applies in a job search. If you focus on the value you bring to a prospective employer, it will:\n\n·      Make the process feel more natural and honest\n·      Help you reframe how you communicate, with a lens on the outcomes you create\n·      Make it easier for employers to quickly answer the question, “Why should we hire this person?”\n\nJob hunting is a skill — and an important one. If you’re looking for practical tips on how to sharpen that skill, one of my favorite resources is Austin Belcak.\n\nYou’ve got this. 💪",

But when you catch yourself waiting for someone to finish speaking so you can respond — instead of truly listening — that’s the perfect moment to pause, lean into self-awareness, and raise your listening game.\n\nI was reminded of this again during a Braver Angels meeting last night. If you’re not familiar with this incredible organization, their mission is to foster thoughtful, respectful cross-political conversations. Sitting in a room where people ask honest questions, listen deeply, and have no agenda to “convert” anyone gives me hope — and reminds me how extraordinary our country can be when curiosity and respect lead the way.\n\nListening is, after all, the only way to take in new information and evolve your understanding of reality. Whether you’re helping a customer solve a business challenge or trying to bridge divides in civic life, it all starts with listening.\n\nIt gives a whole new meaning to the phrase “listen up.”",

The real question is: what should we do about it?\n\nFor me, the answer depends on what I’m trying to accomplish — and I’ve found it’s best to prioritize activities that unlock multiple goals at once.\n\nThe biggest one? Networking (though I prefer to call it relationship building).\n\nLooking for a new role? → Start with your network. They care about you, they know you.\nWant to start a side business? → Who in your network has already done this?\nTrying to learn a new skill (AI, anyone?) → Who in your network is already strong in that area?\nNeed to synthesize your thinking on a complex topic? → Who in your network could deepen the conversation? (Pro move: schedule a dinner with a few people who will make it fascinating.)\n\nSo how do you go about building and cultivating more meaningful relationships?\nFor me, the answer was Beyond Connections. It’s one of the best things I’ve done in years — the methodology, the community, and the results have been invaluable. The next cohort starts soon, and I can’t recommend it highly enough. https://lnkd.in/geuDH5Uf\n\nHowever you approach it, here’s to investing in your relationships. They will pay dividends in more ways than you can imagine.",

You’d think by now this would be standard practice, but surprisingly, even some executive assistants skip this step.\n\nIf I’m asking for your time, I’ll make the effort to figure out where you’re located and send invites in your time zone. It’s a small courtesy that makes a big difference.\n\nBut if you’re asking for my time, help me help you — don’t make me solve the mystery of where you are like it’s an episode of Carmen Sandiego.\n\nPro tip: My go-to tool for juggling multiple time zones is World Time Buddy.\n\nLet’s make scheduling a little less confusing, one time zone at a time. 🌍",

Having spent years understanding why customers buy what they buy, I can tell you that the most valuable insights aren’t generally found in brainstorming sessions or strategy documents — they live with the people who actually use what you build.\n\nYour customers experience your product in real-time and in real‑life contexts. Their feedback highlights hidden pain points, unmet needs, and unexpected delights. By consistently listening, you can spot patterns, validate hypotheses, and challenge assumptions before they become costly mistakes.\n\nThat’s not to say you should ignore feedback from your customer‑facing teams — there will usually be a high degree of overlap — but in my experience, direct customer feedback carries far more weight. Firsthand user experiences reveal nuances that get filtered out internally. Make sure your roadmap starts with the voice of the customer.",

Habits I used to be religious about, but that I let slip when things get busy.\n\nLately, the one that's caught me is the simple confirmation email.\n\nAfter almost any call, it’s good practice to send a quick summary and next steps. I still do this pretty consistently with customer calls—but I’ve gotten a little sloppy with internal ones.\n\nAnd that’s where I’ve been burned. Someone agrees to something, but without a written recap, it slips through the cracks. Totally understandable. But now I’m restarting the process, and it’s on me—not them—to stay sharp on the basics.\n\nThe good news? With AI tools, generating those summaries is easier than ever.

A small percentage of partners will deliver the majority of the value.\n\nBut that 10%? They’ll make it rain.\n\nSo yes, expect to do some slogging to find your 10%.

And, of course, the fear. It’s a constant companion in entrepreneurship, especially in the early days when success can feel distant and uncertain.\n\nBut here’s what I’ve learned: fear fades when revenue starts flowing. That’s why I always guide founders to prioritize sales early. And in my experience, the fastest path to sales is through partnerships.\n\nFind the people who are already selling to your ideal customer. Help them win—deeply and generously. Help your customer win too. That’s the heartbeat of a great partnership.\n\nTest, measure, refine. Then do it again.\n\nHere’s to the boldness, creativity, and resilience of this amazing group of builders. Onward!",

And trust is usually earned over time—but it can be lost in an instant.\n\nFor years, Alaska Airlines was one of my most trusted brands. But in the past year, I’ve noticed a shift. Less focus on the customer. Fewer moments that feel like someone really cares. And last week, when I left my phone in an airport bathroom at SFO, that shift became a clear break in trust.\n\nThe initial mistake was mine. But what followed revealed just how much had changed. Poor processes. No one willing—or empowered—to help. A refusal to even walk seven minutes to a gate where “Find My” clearly showed my phone was sitting. I was even told it had been turned in to Lost & Found... but it never was. Ironically, the police had a process to recover it—if only Alaska had followed theirs.\n\nWhat companies often miss is this: when something goes wrong is your best shot to earn a customer’s loyalty. I would’ve walked away from this experience more loyal than ever. Instead, I walked away for good.\n\nWhether you’re a startup or an enterprise: it’s easier (and far smarter) to grow the trust of your existing customers than to chase new ones.\n\nPlay the long game.\n#CustomerExperience #SalesLeadership #TrustInBusiness",

Absolutely.\n For me, that’s happened more on the personal side than professional. But like anything you want to get better at, approaching setbacks with radical responsibility leads to better answers — and ones you can actually control.\nI’ve created some guardrails for myself: ways to spot issues early, work through them when possible, or move on when it’s time.\nIn my world, I often collaborate with System Integrators and services partners. My advice? Lean in. Be generous with what you’re seeing in the market. Share what’s working for your customers. Even get a little personal with your counterparts.\nThe result? Deeper trust, stronger outcomes, and better results — for everyone involved. Especially your customers",

      "text": "I am so excited to share this. @Keith Ferrazzi is launching his very first in-depth Networking Training.\n\nWe’ve all heard the age-old cliches about networking. \n\nYou are the product of your network. No one successful ever got there alone. People do business with people they like.\n\nYou may think that to build a world class network you’ve got to be super charismatic, or an extrovert, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nSure, charisma helps. \n\nBut what’s more important is having a system in place that is effective and that you follow consistently so you're always top of mind to the right people.\n\nAnd when you do engage with those people, you've got to be able to go deep and build rapport - quickly and consistently. Because the goal is really to build relationships, not just a long list of barely-acquaintances. \n\nThese are not things you're born with. They can absolutely be taught.\n\nA study published in Harvard Business Review last year tracked almost 2,000 partners at professional services firms to understand what the rainmakers were doing differently.\n\nWhat they found was that the “Activators” as they called them had a system of regular, weekly activities in their calendar. And the system was focused on grooming their network of relationships.\n\nThose Activators generated 30% more revenue than their peers in the study, and 50% more revenue than the worst performing persona (the Experts…who banked on publishing articles to help them close deals with clients).\n\nI’ve known @Keith Ferrazzi since he published his NYTimes #1 bestseller Never Eat Alone twenty years ago.\n\nThe book sold 1mm+ copies, has been translated into 15+ languages, and is one of the classics on networking.\n\nI’ve heard Keith called the most networked man in America.\n\nAnd to celebrate this anniversary, Keith and his team have taken the most powerful practices from this book and created a live, online training program called Beyond Connections.\n\nThey are enrolling now, and spots are limited for the first cohort beginning this June and running eight weeks.\n\nSo if you want to be more strategic about your network and learn how to build deep, lasting connections… you can apply to the program here: https://lnkd.in/geuDH5Uf",

      "text": "We all know how important communication is to our personal and professional lives.\n \nOne of the things I’ve been paying a lot more attention to over the last decade, both at work and at home, is the balance and intensity of communication.\n \nI’ve noticed that when things get stressful, most of us are comforted by certainty (or the illusion of it). I think that without realizing it, that often means looking to the loudest or most confident voice in the room.\n \nMaybe we need a new name for this all-too-human fallacy. Because the loudest voice in the room is often not the rightest voice in the room. I think this is part of the gender dynamic that becomes problematic as we work to evolve our society. In stressful situations, men tend to display more anger and/or control. Women lean more toward questioning the steps that led to the undesired situation and consensus building. Anger and control inspire confidence. Questioning and looking to others for their opinions doesn’t usually.\n \nPlease note that I have little patience for the “men are scum and/or women are crazy” narrative. The only productive path forward involves a nuanced blend of raw truth, grace toward other humans and extreme ownership of our own role and actions.\n \nI recall a great podcast interview with Indra Nooryi (and Tim Ferriss) where she gave an example of this. She was an SVP at the time and was frustrated at not being heard by the other male SVPs. In an exec meeting, she turned to the male SVP next to her and asked him to propose an idea (she said this in a way so that the entire room could hear the exchange). He was confused and asked why she didn’t propose it. She explained that it would get dismissed if she voiced it but that it had a much greater chance of being heard if he said it. To their credit, the other SVPs worked with her to address and resolve the issue.\n \nWe’ve all seen men who are aggressive and dominant. But we’ve all also seen women who are too passive and too quick to stand down. Neither is ideal in every situation.\n \nObviously, leaders need to be mindful of and intentional about heading off this dynamic. But we ladies do as well. Pick your time and place, but whenever possible, we need to speak up and help others around us see what’s happening.\n \nTo solve hard problems, which is what we need to do in the current climate, we’re going to need to do things we haven’t done before. We need more ideas and voices at the table and we need to listen (really listen) to voices that have not are not being heard.",

We have one Fortune 100 client who made 15 hires from one diversity hiring event over 9 months. Here’s the kicker. They say the ROI from the event was too low because they only made 2 of those hires in the first 45 days.\n \nEveryone I talk with is trying to hire more diverse talent. But here’s the thing…..it takes longer. I’m a big fan of experimenting. So, if you want to hire more diverse talent, try adjusting your quarterly targets to annual targets and see what happens. #diversityhiring",

I was blown away and so inspired by their commitment to help others, hard work in the face of so many obstacles and raw human goodness.\n \nI work for such an amazing company and our customers are some of the most beautiful humans I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with. And yet I rarely let myself take the time to just sit in on these sessions and grow from and bathe in the wisdom, insights and beautiful energy. Thank you for the reminder to fix this Isabella Frediani Jennifer Boicic Marcus Torres",
