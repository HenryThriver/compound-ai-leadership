    "en": "I’m a Go-To-Market Strategist with a flair for Partnerships. Over the course of my career, I’ve closed the largest deal in company history 3x — often with some of the biggest brands on the planet like Microsoft, Costco, Expedia, Starbucks, Meta, and Nike — by building high-trust, long-term relationships. \n\n●\t22+ years leading SaaS solution sales to Fortune 500s with direct and with Partners\n●\tWorked hand-in-hand with a Global SI to close a multi-7-figure deal with Costco \n●\tClosed largest deal in company history 3x  in my career \n●\tCreated a series of executive events across the country that led to a 5x increase in pipeline growth in North America at  BMC \n●\tEstablished improved processes for bi-annual customer meetings leading to team-wide pipeline growth improvements of 3x \n●\tDeeply committed to the craft of Sales, continually investing my own time and resources to sharpen my skills and effectiveness\n\nI’m recognized as a consistent performer and for orchestrating complex, multi-stakeholder deals, reframing solutions into business growth levers, and building deep relationships at the C-suite level. My success spans the full sales cycle — from pipeline generation to large-scale enterprise deployment.\n\nI take a broad and creative view of partnerships, using strategies that range from co-selling and collaborative events to knowledge-sharing and ecosystem development. I’ve helped startups unlock new revenue streams through strategic alliances that drive net-new clients, and I’ve sold everything from highly technical software platforms, green-tech solutions, consulting services, and personal development programs.\n\nI’m deeply committed to continuous growth. I’ve completed nearly 20 sales training programs and have invested heavily in developing my skills in value-based selling, networking, prospecting, negotiation, and communication.\n\nYou can reach me at lesley.carstens@gmail.com."
