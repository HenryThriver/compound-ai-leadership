  "summary": "I have been in the sales training industry for a decade. I have deep knowledge about the skills and behaviors that allow sellers to drive results. I have designed sales training curriculums for organizations globally across many industries. I have experience leading a curriculum design process from needs analysis to implementation. I walk the talk, using the skills I build into my training in my own engagements with stakeholders to influence, support sellers in designing solutions and build relationships. \n\nI recently became a certified coach. I help people see things that others miss. My listening and questioning skills allow me to solve for root causes of tough challenges and engage in deeper dialogues with team members and stakeholders.\n\nI'm passionate about creating processes that help sellers get results more quickly. My three pillars for a successful sales training and enablement initiative are applying practical learning approaches, setting clear expectations for adoption and building accountability into any new process.\n\nPersonally, I love gardening, pilates, macrame, reading, and reality tv. I'm always open to listening to new music and love seeing movies at the theatre. My personal goal for 2025 is to complete my ACC certification through the ICF. \n\nFun fact: I worked at a movie theatre in high school as a team trainer, so my roots in training run deep! \n\nCAPABILITIES\nStakeholder alignment, project management, executive presence, verbal and written communication, instructional design, solution development, proposal development, discovery, positioning, coaching, problem solving. \n\nSOFTWARE\nMicrosoft office suite (PowerPoint is a specific strength), Google Workspace, Articulate 360, Highspot, Showpad, Salesforce",

    "en": "I have been in the sales training industry for a decade. I have deep knowledge about the skills and behaviors that allow sellers to drive results. I have designed sales training curriculums for organizations globally across many industries. I have experience leading a curriculum design process from needs analysis to implementation. I walk the talk, using the skills I build into my training in my own engagements with stakeholders to influence, support sellers in designing solutions and build relationships. \n\nI recently became a certified coach. I help people see things that others miss. My listening and questioning skills allow me to solve for root causes of tough challenges and engage in deeper dialogues with team members and stakeholders.\n\nI'm passionate about creating processes that help sellers get results more quickly. My three pillars for a successful sales training and enablement initiative are applying practical learning approaches, setting clear expectations for adoption and building accountability into any new process.\n\nPersonally, I love gardening, pilates, macrame, reading, and reality tv. I'm always open to listening to new music and love seeing movies at the theatre. My personal goal for 2025 is to complete my ACC certification through the ICF. \n\nFun fact: I worked at a movie theatre in high school as a team trainer, so my roots in training run deep! \n\nCAPABILITIES\nStakeholder alignment, project management, executive presence, verbal and written communication, instructional design, solution development, proposal development, discovery, positioning, coaching, problem solving. \n\nSOFTWARE\nMicrosoft office suite (PowerPoint is a specific strength), Google Workspace, Articulate 360, Highspot, Showpad, Salesforce"
