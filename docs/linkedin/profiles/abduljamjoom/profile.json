Throughout my internship, I have successfully developed four main tools: \n\n1. Variable Utilization Project\n* Worked with a team of three engineers to design the architecture of, and implement, a scalable data pipeline that automatically updates and maintains Adobe Analytics data for internal analysis (SQL, Sequalize, Adobe Analytics API, Node.js)\n* Created a virtualized UI that enables users to view, edit, map, and analyze Adobe Analytics data (Aurelia, Node.js)\n\n2. Data Sampling Tool\n* Created an API for sampling data from Adobe Analytics (Aurelia API). Use Case - pulling data from Adobe Analytics could take hours or even days, depending on the size of the request, so I've created a sampling functionality that runs in several seconds and fetches a sample of the data pull request for approval before initiating the full data pull request\n* Designed and implemented the data sampling UI\n\n3. Time Estimation Model\n* Designed and implemented a data pull request time estimation model for the Adobe Analytics API with an average error of 15 mins\n* The model used a random forest regressor along with several extracted features to estimate how much time the data pull request will take\n\n4. Developed a secure internal email notifications system (SMTP) that has voluntarily been activated by almost all the users",

      "description": "I worked with a team of engineers to develop an internal scalable data pipeline for Adobe Analytics that aims to simplify the process of gathering and cleaning data for Adobe data scientists. Throughout my internship, I have successfully developed four main tools: \n\n1. Variable Utilization Project\n* Worked with a team of three engineers to design the architecture of, and implement, a scalable data pipeline that automatically updates and maintains Adobe Analytics data for internal analysis (SQL, Sequalize, Adobe Analytics API, Node.js)\n* Created a virtualized UI that enables users to view, edit, map, and analyze Adobe Analytics data (Aurelia, Node.js)\n\n2. Data Sampling Tool\n* Created an API for sampling data from Adobe Analytics (Aurelia API). Use Case - pulling data from Adobe Analytics could take hours or even days, depending on the size of the request, so I've created a sampling functionality that runs in several seconds and fetches a sample of the data pull request for approval before initiating the full data pull request\n* Designed and implemented the data sampling UI\n\n3. Time Estimation Model\n* Designed and implemented a data pull request time estimation model for the Adobe Analytics API with an average error of 15 mins\n* The model used a random forest regressor along with several extracted features to estimate how much time the data pull request will take\n\n4. Developed a secure internal email notifications system (SMTP) that has voluntarily been activated by almost all the users",
