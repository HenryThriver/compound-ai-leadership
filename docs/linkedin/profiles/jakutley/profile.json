  "summary": "I lead the strategic oversight and optimisation of sales and marketing technology ecosystems at Certinia. My focus is operationalising go-to-market systems that combine data, process, and people to scale revenue impact.\n\nI manage complex technical stacks from end to end, optimising workflows for every sales role to eliminate administrative friction. I’m particularly passionate about AI and automation, identifying and implementing machine learning solutions that automate repetitive tasks, improve forecast accuracy, and create tangible business impact through cross-platform workflows.\n\nI refine reporting, improve opportunity conversion rates and territory coverage, and implement automation that maximises coverage and efficiency, with hands-on experience in Salesforce-native workflows, Outreach, 6sense, and AI-assisted prospecting.\n\nI design and refine lead-to-opportunity processes whilst standardising workflows across Field Sales Ops, Marketing Ops, and Sales Leadership to ensure organisational alignment.\n\nI believe the right technology, properly implemented, should feel invisible. It should just make good work easier. My goal is to build systems that are both powerful and practical, where innovation translates directly into results that drive revenue generation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nDad to 2 daughters #breakthebias | Former record shop owner | Entrepreneur | Caffeine-fueled | Vegan foodie | There is no Planet B",

    "en": "I lead the strategic oversight and optimisation of sales and marketing technology ecosystems at Certinia. My focus is operationalising go-to-market systems that combine data, process, and people to scale revenue impact.\n\nI manage complex technical stacks from end to end, optimising workflows for every sales role to eliminate administrative friction. I’m particularly passionate about AI and automation, identifying and implementing machine learning solutions that automate repetitive tasks, improve forecast accuracy, and create tangible business impact through cross-platform workflows.\n\nI refine reporting, improve opportunity conversion rates and territory coverage, and implement automation that maximises coverage and efficiency, with hands-on experience in Salesforce-native workflows, Outreach, 6sense, and AI-assisted prospecting.\n\nI design and refine lead-to-opportunity processes whilst standardising workflows across Field Sales Ops, Marketing Ops, and Sales Leadership to ensure organisational alignment.\n\nI believe the right technology, properly implemented, should feel invisible. It should just make good work easier. My goal is to build systems that are both powerful and practical, where innovation translates directly into results that drive revenue generation.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nDad to 2 daughters #breakthebias | Former record shop owner | Entrepreneur | Caffeine-fueled | Vegan foodie | There is no Planet B"
