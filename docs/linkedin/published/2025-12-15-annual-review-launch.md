## Original Draft (Henry's)

> I've been doing extensive annual reviews for the last 7 years and it's proven hugely helpful for me to reflect and refine. More than anything, it brings me tremendous peace knowing where I've been this past year, my priorities right now, and what I'll focus on in the coming year.

## Draft v3 (Current)

For the last 7 years I've done an Annual Review process that brings me peace, clarity, and focus.

Friends have been asking me to share my flow for years, and it never felt right - until now.

I've built a free site that walks you through my exact process. I do every one of the 70+ questions and exercises, and it takes 5-10 hours over the course of a week. This space to reflect helps me know where I've been, what matters right now, and where I'm aiming the laser beam.

All this is possible because of AI-assisted engineering, of course.

Launching later this week. Link in comments to get notified when it goes live.

## Constitutional Validation

| Principle | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Value-first | ✅ Pass | Free tool, years of development |
| Authentic | ✅ Pass | Conversational, "laser beam" feels like him |
| Clear point | ✅ Pass | One message: coming soon, sign up |
| Not a hook | ✅ Pass | Real story, no performative energy |
| Discovery-focused | ⚠️ Borderline | "Share my thing" not discovery — appropriate for announcement |
| Thriving-aligned | ✅ Pass | Perfect fit for Personal Thriving |

**Accepted as-is** — borderline on #5 is expected for announcement posts.
