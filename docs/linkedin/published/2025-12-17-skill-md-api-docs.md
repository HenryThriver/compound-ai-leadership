# SKILL.md as the Next API Docs

## Intent

**Topic:** Prediction that vendors will ship SKILL.md/AGENT.md files as official documentation for AI agents
**Goal:** Thought leadership / prediction grounded in personal experience
**Energy:** 7-8/10
**Lane:** AI for Professional Thriving

**Core argument:**
- Bold prediction: Vendors will ship SKILL.md/AGENT.md as official docs
- Evidence: "I know because I'm doing it manually right now"
- The janky reality: Everyone building their own skills with varying success
- The ideal: Download/import directly from vendor like API docs

**Specific vendors named:**
- Supabase
- ShadCN (component library)
- Coval (at work)
- BigQuery data warehouse schemas

## Draft v3 (Current)

Soon, vendors will ship SKILL.md and AGENT.md (what I'll call Skillz) files akin to API docs.

I've been doing this manually for months now - taking APIs / MCPs / docs and asking Claude Code to make Skillz to interact with Supabase, Vercel, ShadCN, Coval, and BigQuery.

I get much better results, more consistently, for fewer tokens.

But everyone building their own Skillz is janky. Varying quality and incomplete coverage with no official support.

What I want is for vendors to ship canonical SKILL.md files alongside their API docs. Same information - endpoints, patterns, gotchas - but natively plugging into my Claude Code.

We are graduating past developer tools (I'm not *technically* a developer) into agent manager tools. Who builds, manages, trains, and evangelizes skills within organizations (both internal and customer facing) is a big open question.
