## Revision Notes

- Original draft had typo: "nuisances" instead of "nuances"
- Moved from leading with source to leading with insight
- Iterated on "Top 1%" framing: "Top 1% conversation" felt gatekeeping; "Top 1% understanding" is aspirational and inviting
- Kept question CTA per author preference (more direct)
