### Topics He Writes About
| Topic | Frequency | Confidence |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Voice AI market/industry dynamics | High | High |
| Voice AI technical challenges (latency, realism, multilingual) | High | High |
| Startup ecosystem (fundraising, building teams) | Medium | High |
| Early-stage startup investing lessons | Medium | Medium |

### Hot Takes / Contrarian Views
- **"Voice AI is very, very early"** - Believes most voice AI hasn't passed the "Audio Turing Test" and this is causing meaningful harm to voice AI businesses
- **Bet on the founder, not the plan** - Reshared Richard Ni's post: "most people far overrate the importance of having a master plan that makes sense from year 1, and far underrate the importance of having a top tier leader who will find a way"
- **Discipline vs Fear in investing** - Discipline is passing on something that doesn't fit your strategy; fear is passing because the number makes you uncomfortable

- Michael Silver (Kaizen founder) - reposts frequently, seems close
- Sami Shalabi (Maven AGI)
- Andy Chou (Ventrilo.ai) - mentioned as angel/advisor
