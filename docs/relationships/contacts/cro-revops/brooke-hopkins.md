## Content POG Surface

### Topics She Writes About (high confidence, recurring)
- **LLM-as-a-judge evaluation** - limitations, calibration, variance issues
- **Human feedback in AI systems** - "automated evals don't replace humans, they amplify them"
- **Voice AI testing & QA** - her core business focus
- **Trust & transparency in AI** - connecting to autonomous driving principles
- **Simulation for AI agents** - from Waymo to voice/chat agents

### Hot Takes / Contrarian Views
- "Most LLM-as-a-judge variance isn't the judge being flaky - it's that we're asking one number to capture quality for open-ended tasks" (high confidence, observed)
- "Focus less on individual scores, more on trends" (medium confidence, observed)
- "Transparent evaluation builds confidence internally, with regulators, and with users" (high confidence, recurring theme)

### Thinkers She Follows/Mentions
- **Hamel Husain** - mentions his eval flashcards admiringly, quotes his frameworks
- Waymo team - still connected, proud of Safety Hub launch

### Papers/Frameworks She References
- "Artificial Hivemind: The Open-Ended Homogeneity of Language Models" - recommends for eval builders

### Content Preferences
- Posts with images/graphics
- Data-driven, practical insights
- Shares specific technical recommendations
- Weekly "This week in Conversational AI" roundup posts
