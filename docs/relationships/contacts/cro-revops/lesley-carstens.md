## Content POG Surface

### Topics She Writes About (Recurring Themes)
1. **Ethical Selling / Sales-as-Service** - Very strong theme. Views selling as helping, not pushing. Quotes: "ethical selling - influencing in service of what's best for others"
2. **Partnerships as Revenue Accelerator** - Believes partnerships are the fastest path to revenue. "Other humans and companies are the wormholes to whatever future you're trying to create"
3. **Relationship Building / Networking** - Prefers "relationship building" over "networking". Big advocate for Beyond Connections methodology
4. **Job Search as Sales** - Coaches job seekers to reframe their search as selling themselves
5. **Hard Conversations / Conflict Resolution** - Values the skill of addressing difficult topics with clarity and respect
6. **Listening as Superpower** - "Listening is the better part of communication"
7. **Generosity First** - Recurring theme: give first, give generously, earn the right to sell
8. **Cross-political dialogue** - Active in Braver Angels (fostering respectful cross-political conversations)

### Thinkers She Follows/Quotes

- "If emotions are elevated or 5-6 back-and-forths without resolution, talk live"
- "Test, measure, refine. Then do it again."
- "There are few business problems that can't be solved with more sales"

### Hot Takes / Contrarian Views
- Social media should have expertise weighting (Ray Dalio-style meritocracy for platforms)
- Most organizations swing between authoritarian and democratic models - neither optimal
- Webinars that don't share duration are disrespectful of people's time
- AI strategies are exploding but the human element (like call duration) still matters

### Learning Interests

- Continuously invests in sales training
- Personal development programs

### Content Style
- Thoughtful, reflective posts
