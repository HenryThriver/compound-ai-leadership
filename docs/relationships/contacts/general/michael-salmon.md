---

## Why Important

- Former client relationship = established trust
- Building with AI = aligned interests
- Partner (Ricky Lee) wants to connect = potential network expansion
- GTM focus = relevant to job search / expertise areas
- Product innovation expertise = potential collaboration or advisory opportunity
- Serial founder with exits = experienced operator perspective

---

## Conversation Context

Michael reached out after seeing Henry's AI posts. Key quotes from his message:
- "My partner has done a killer job keeping on the advancements"
- "We've now been able to build our entire business with just us in such a brief time"
- Running GTM workshop "building it all with AI"

Henry shared cal link and phone number. Ball is in Michael's court to schedule.

---

## Open Loops

- **Intro to partner (Ricky Lee)** - Michael wants to connect Henry with his partner who's been following AI advancements. Status: Queued (waiting for Michael to facilitate)

---

## POG Opportunities

- AI workflow content that might help their GTM work
- Voice AI insights (if relevant to VYE)
- Dax Shepard intro (if Henry has any connection)
- UK market connections for VYE launch

## Next Actions

- [ ] Wait for Michael or Ricky to schedule via cal link

- [ ] Consider if any network connections could help with UK launch or Dax Shepard intro
