## Executive Summary

**Decision:** GO — Apply to REALITY iTrek Israel AI/Tech cohort (May 2026)

**Why:** This is a classic asymmetric bet. The application costs a few hours; the upside is a visceral understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a tight-knit network in AI/tech, and an experience that deeply inspired my best friend Glenn. All three decision frameworks (Type 1/2, Asymmetric Bets, Regret Minimization) point strongly to GO. The only tension—a week away from family—is acknowledged and solvable with advance coordination.

**Key risk and mitigation:**
- Hannah carries extra load during trip → Coordinate family/friend support well in advance

**Success looks like:**
- Accepted to the program
- Deep, nuanced understanding of the conflict
- Lasting relationships with AI/tech cohort members

**Next action:** Complete the application

## Context

Reality Eyetrek Israel is a program that Henry's best friend Glenn completed in September 2025. The connection chain:
- Glenn was inspired by his ex-girlfriend Adriana, who served on the Reality board
- Henry attended an informational session and was deeply impressed by educator Michael
- Henry attended a Hanukkah networking event hosted by someone in Glenn's cohort
- Program is in May 2026

The decision at hand: **Apply to the program** (not yet deciding to attend—just to apply).

## Process Log

### Phase 0: Initialization
- Document created: 2026-01-05
- Category: Personal (new category created)
- Initial context captured from user

### Phase 1: Baseline Intuition

**Magic wand scenario:**
Two things unlock if this goes perfectly:
1. Deeper understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with hands-on, visceral experience (the program's core premise)
2. A targeted, closely-knit network of people in AI/tech functional area — the AI/Tech NSF cohort specifically

**Gut feel:** Super inspired. Excited.

**Concerns:**
- One week away from family = heavy burden on Hannah
- Will need to coordinate support from family/friends/relatives for Hannah and Zev

**Resolution on concerns:** "All of that is solvable, and if I get accepted, it's a truly amazing opportunity."

**Why this cohort:** May 2026 is specifically the AI/Tech cohort — functional alignment with career focus.

**Energy:** High excitement, clear inspiration

### Phase 2: Framework Analysis (Condensed)

**Applicable frameworks:** Type 1/Type 2, Asymmetric Bets, Regret Minimization

#### Type 1 / Type 2 (Reversibility)
- **Applying** = Type 2 (fully reversible). Can always decline if accepted.
- **Attending** = More Type 1-ish (time commitment, family coordination), but still reversible until you're on the plane.
- **Verdict:** Type 2. Move fast, don't over-deliberate.

#### Asymmetric Bets
- **Downside (if rejected or don't go):** A few hours on application. Minimal.
- **Upside (if accepted and attend):**
  - Deep understanding of Israeli-Palestinian conflict
  - Tight-knit AI/tech network
  - Experience that inspired best friend Glenn
  - Connection to Jewish/Jewish-adjacent community
- **Verdict:** Highly asymmetric in favor. Low cost, high potential value.

#### Regret Minimization
- At 80, looking back: Would you regret not applying when your best friend just did it, you were inspired by the info session, and the AI cohort aligns perfectly?
- **Verdict:** Clear regret if you don't apply.

**Framework consensus:** 3/3 frameworks point strongly to GO.

### Phase 3: Value Alignment (Personal Values)

Checking against personal values:
- **Thriving:** Seeking growth, connection, understanding → ✅
- **Study/Curiosity:** Learning about complex geopolitical situation firsthand → ✅
- **Kindness/Compassion:** Understanding conflict to develop more nuanced compassion → ✅
- **Relational Health (Human):** Building community, networking with AI cohort → ✅
- **Relational Health (Family):** Tension point — week away from Hannah/Zev. Acknowledged and solvable.

**Value alignment:** Strong across the board. Family tension is real but manageable.

### Phase 4: Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Burden on Hannah during trip | High | Medium | Coordinate family/friend support in advance |
| Not accepted | Medium | Low | Apply anyway; rejection costs nothing |
| Schedule conflicts in May | Low | Medium | Check calendar before applying |
