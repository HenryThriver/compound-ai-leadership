## Page 3: Essays and Recognition

### Essay 1: Values (no word limit specified)

**Prompt:** REALITY's values include equity, impact, optimism, humility, and collaboration. Which value do you hold the most dear and why?

**Draft:**
```
Collaboration.

There's an African proverb I return to often: "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." The more experience I get, the more I believe that meaningful outcomes—at any scale—require collaboration.

I've lived this across personal and professional facets of my life. For many years, large and small-scale event production has been one of my creative outlets. What I love most is the layered collaboration: with co-creators behind the scenes, with participants during the experience, and with the community that forms after. Building and working in startups has proven the same point—the magic isn't the idea, it's the team I work with and how we create together.

Now I'm fascinated by a new kind of collaboration: humans working alongside AI. The same social contracts still work, just differently—AI amplifies what teams can accomplish rather than replacing human creativity and intuition. I find this frontier endlessly interesting, and I bring the same orientation I bring to any collaboration: genuine curiosity about what others bring to the table, and a commitment to drawing out perspectives that might otherwise stay hidden.
```

**Notes:**
- Subtext: collaborative energy, will be additive to cohort
- Ends on curiosity + drawing out others = invitational excellence without saying it
- AI line references his Inc. article framing

### Essay 2: Leadership Journey (150 words max)

**Prompt:** Participants are selected for REALITY based on their accomplishments, contributions and leadership in their field or community and the impact they've made. Tell us about your professional or lay leader journey. What moments and achievements have defined your personal or professional leadership path and what drives your passion for what you do?

**Draft:**
```
The leadership moment that defined me happened outside my career. While training circus arts in San Diego, I noticed incredible talent in our community with no real platform to perform. So I produced a feature-length interactive circus from scratch—raising the investment, assembling the team, and ultimately bringing together over 100 artists and performers for an original 90-minute show. I wasn't a performer myself. I just saw what was possible and created the conditions for others to shine.

That pattern followed me into tech. Whether building startup teams or leading hybrid human-AI operations, I focus on creating psychological safety alongside high standards—environments where people take meaningful risks, grow, and produce exceptional work. My teams have driven significant revenue growth, deployed voice AI systems managing 30k+ monthly calls, and consistently say they grew under my leadership.

I'm driven by seeing untapped potential and creating the conditions for people to thrive—personally and professionally.
```

**Word count:** 150/150

**Notes:**
- Opens with circus story (unexpected, memorable)
- "I wasn't a performer myself" = not about ego, about elevating others
- Bridges to professional with same pattern
- Concrete metrics (328% ARR, 30K interactions)
- Ends on "building the stage" — cohort subtext: will do this for the group too

### Essay 3: Israel/Jewish Connection (100 words max)

**Prompt:** REALITY explores Israeli culture, history and society as a platform for understanding complexities in participants' own communities and industries. We neither assume nor expect any level of previous knowledge. Given that, tell us about your interest or connection to Israel, Jewish values and the Jewish community.

**Draft:**
```
My family immigrated as political refugees from Odessa, Ukraine in 1988. We arrived with very little, and Jewish organizations—HIAS, Chabad, Jewish Family Services—helped us establish ourselves in America. I carry deep gratitude for that.

I received a Chabad education for nine years, and while I consider myself culturally Jewish rather than observant, those values shaped me. My only visit to Israel was a Birthright trip about 13 years ago, where I also spent time with family before and after the program.

I'm drawn to REALITY because I want to deepen my understanding of Israel and the complexities surrounding it—with nuance, firsthand experience, and people who bring different perspectives.
```

**Word count:** 100/100

**Notes:**
- Opens with refugee story and gratitude — authentic, grounding
- Acknowledges cultural vs. observant distinction honestly
- Birthright + family visit shows existing connection
- Ends on wanting to learn with nuance and diverse perspectives — good cohort energy

## Notes & Guidance

**Source:** Former selection committee member at networking event

**Key insight:** The selection committee is building a cohort, not selecting individuals in isolation. They want to see:
- **How will YOU be additive to the GROUP?**
- How does your experience, background, and worldview contribute to the overall group dynamics?
- Will you mesh well AND contribute unique perspectives that enrich others' experience?

**Strategic implication for essays:**
- Frame answers in terms of what you BRING to the group, not just personal accomplishments
- Show how your unique background/perspective adds value to a diverse cohort
- Demonstrate you're someone who elevates group experiences, not just an impressive individual
