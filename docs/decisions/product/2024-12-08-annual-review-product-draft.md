# Decision: Build Annual Review Product

**Date:** 2024-12-08
**Category:** product
**Status:** Draft - Pending final decision
**Decision Maker:** Henry

## Summary
Evaluating whether to build a small product that productizes my 7-year annual review process, including templates from other thought leaders.

## Context
- 7 years of annual review practice, currently in Notion
- Current process is "clunky" - friction in setup and analysis
- Aligned with AI-leadership thesis: productize personal workflows
- Fits the Every model: content + products in parallel
- Potential wedge product for newsletter audience

## Decision Framework Applied
- **Primary:** Regret Minimization → At 80, would regret not trying
- **Secondary:** Asymmetric Bets → Limited downside, open upside
- **Supporting:** Type 2 (Reversible) → Don't over-deliberate

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Keep using Notion** - Works but doesn't compound or productize
2. **Focus only on newsletter** - Misses revenue validation opportunity
3. **Build something else** - What? This scratches my own itch.

## Hypothesis
We believe that **building an annual review tool for myself** will result in **a better review experience AND a viable product** because **I have 7 years of iteration and the target user is me**.

### Assumptions
- [ ] People pay for annual review tools (validate: check competitors)
- [ ] My process is transferable (validate: can I articulate it?)
- [ ] I can ship fast enough to use for 2024 review (validate: scope check)

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Deadline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Ship MVP | Live product | 2024-12-31 |
| Complete my own review | Using the product | 2025-01-15 |
| First paying customer | $1 revenue | 2025-01-31 |
| Newsletter tie-in | Published post about it | 2025-02 |

## Tradeoffs

### Gains
- Solves my own annual review friction
- Creates content for newsletter (build in public)
- Tests the "productize annoyances" model
- Revenue validation opportunity

### Costs
- Time/energy investment (estimate: [TBD] hours)
- Potential distraction from other priorities

### Risks
- Over-scoping → Mitigation: MVP = my flow only
- Never shipping → Mitigation: Hard deadline of Dec 31
- No market → Mitigation: I'm customer #1, so it's still valuable

### Accepting
- v1 will be rough
- Might not find market beyond myself (and that's okay)

## Open Questions (Answer before finalizing)

1. **MVP scope:**
   - [ ] Just my annual review flow?
   - [ ] Plus 2-3 templates from others (Tiago, Ness Labs, etc)?
   - [ ] Storage/analysis features?

2. **Tech stack:**
   - [ ] Vibe code with what? (Next.js? Static? Notion template?)

3. **Monetization:**
   - [ ] One-time purchase?
   - [ ] Annual subscription (fitting for annual review)?
   - [ ] Freemium with paid vault/storage?

4. **Timeline:**
   - [ ] Hours available before Dec 31?
   - [ ] What's the minimum shippable version?

## Review Schedule
- [ ] Dec 15: Check progress, adjust scope if needed
- [ ] Dec 31: Ship or document why not
- [ ] Jan 31: First revenue check
