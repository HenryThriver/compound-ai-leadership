## Executive Summary

**Decision:** GO — Build and launch Annual Review product by 12/12

**Why:** Time-sensitive opportunity (annual review season 12/12-1/11) with asymmetric risk profile. Downside capped at ~5 days + mild ego bruising. Upside includes persona building, content engine, portfolio piece, mission fulfillment, and potential revenue. All six frameworks support, intuition aligns, values check out.

**Key risks and mitigations:**
1. Scope creep → MVP spec locked: Landing → Start → Account → Save → Done. Nothing else.
2. Aesthetics rabbit hole → Templates, AI design, explicit "good enough" bar
3. Minutiae paralysis → Gut check: "Does this serve the core flow?"

**Success looks like:**
- Emotional: 100 people complete an annual review
- Financial: 100 paying users (any amount)
- Operational: Funnel data to inform future tuning

**We'll know it's working when:**
- Users complete reviews (not just start them)
- Qualitative feedback suggests value delivered

**Review schedule:**
- 2025-01-15: Post-season retrospective (completions, payments, learnings)

## Context

Henry has run an annual review process for 7 years. Currently done in Notion, but the experience is "clunky." Considering building a small product that:
- Productizes his personal annual review flow
- Includes templates from other thought leaders (Tiago, Ness Labs, etc.)
- Could be a small subscription offering
- Aligns with the "content + product in parallel" strategy (Every model)
- Serves as a proof point for the AI-augmented leadership thesis

## Process Log

### Phase 0: Initialization
- Document created: 2025-12-08
- Initial context captured
- Old v1 draft archived to `docs/decisions/archive/`

### Phase 1: Baseline Intuition

**Q1: Magic wand scenario**

*Wildest dreams:* Recurring revenue sufficient to never need to work for anyone else again.

*Realistic best case:*
- Effective hook to build "AI for Thriving Guy" persona
- Content engine for newsletter and LinkedIn
- Interactive portfolio piece
- Low-stakes "throwaway" product to test compounding patterns (both engineering and business)
- Minimal emotional/intellectual investment = freedom to experiment

**Q2: Worst case fear**

*Surface fear:* Look like an idiot, no engagement, feels like wasted effort.

*Reframe:* Doubt it's actually a waste because:
- Residual content from public failure is still meaningful/valuable
- Building in public doesn't make me look like an idiot

*Real cost:* Opportunity cost of time. Time is the finite resource here.

**Q3: Gut check**

*Feeling:* Super excited. Thinks it'll be fun.

*Tension:* Nervous about spinning up another coding project when physical world commitments exist (e.g., cleaning garage).

*Time pressure:* This has urgency—annual review product becomes irrelevant quickly if not shipped. Must commit to MVP before starting or it'll wilt on the desk until it doesn't make sense anymore.

*HARD DEADLINE:* Want product open 12/12 - 1/11 (annual review season). **Must launch publicly by this weekend (4-5 days from today).**

**Q4: Inspiration**

*Personal:* "I want it for myself." Want to organize last few years of approaches into a systematic offering to share.

*Reputation:* Thinks it'll be a good look while offering real value.

*Mission:* "If it helps even 100 people do their annual reviews, I would consider that a huge win. Even if I make no money, I believe strongly in the mission of helping people Thrive by supporting their ability to reflect effectively and purposefully."

**Q5: Energy read**

- Making the thing: **Energized**
- Launching it: Neutral to drained
- Aesthetics/visual design: **Super draining**

*Implication:* Design choices could be a blocker. Might need to lean on templates, AI-generated design, or "good enough" aesthetics to preserve energy for the build.

### Phase 2: Framework Selection

**Pattern identified:** "Should I start X?" with hard deadline and constrained resources.

**Frameworks selected:**
1. Regret Minimization — Would I regret not trying?
2. Asymmetric Bets — Capped downside, open upside
3. Speed vs Quality — 4-5 days forces brutal prioritization
4. Opportunity Cost — What else could this time buy?
5. Reversibility (Type 1/Type 2) — One-way or two-way door?
6. Inversion — Curious to explore "how would this fail?"

**Dropped:** Second-Order Effects (overkill for quick MVP)

### Phase 3: Clarifying Questions

**Q1 (Reversibility):** If it flops, can you just stop?
**A1:** "Stopping is easy!" — No ongoing costs or commitments. Pure Type 2 decision.

**Q2 (Opportunity Cost):** What's the alternative use of the next 4-5 days?
**A2:**
- Packing: Will happen no matter what (non-negotiable)
- Garage cleaning: BIG THING, requires significant mental mojo, decision fatigue on where all the little bits go

*Note:* Garage is decision-fatigue heavy. Product building is *different* type of mental energy—might actually complement rather than compete.

**Q3 (Speed vs Quality):** Absolute minimum that still feels like a real product?
**A3:**
- Landing page with info
- Click to start
- Create account, save progress until done
- Once done, answers for this year saved and stored

*That's it.* No fancy analytics, no multiple templates, no year-over-year comparison. Just: answer questions → save.

**Q4 (Inversion):** What would guarantee failure?
**A4:**
1. **Scope creep** — Adding features beyond MVP
2. **Chasing beauty** — Trying hard on aesthetics in ways I don't know/understand (and find draining)
3. **Minutiae rabbit holes** — Getting lost in details that don't serve the simple vision

*Inversion takeaway:* To succeed, ruthlessly cut scope, accept "good enough" design, stay focused on the core flow.

*Tension noted:* "Minimal quality I'm willing to put out" is a real constraint. High standards of excellence vs. ship early/often is a constant balancing act.

**Q5 (Regret Minimization):** At 80, would you regret not packaging/sharing your annual review practice?
**A5:** "It's deeply personal, so I don't think I'd regret not shipping *this specific thing.*"

But: "I would likely regret not building *things* that come up for me."

*Nuance:* The regret risk isn't about THIS product—it's about the pattern. Not shipping things when they arise and make sense is the regret. This one is timely, aligned with current vibe-coding momentum, and makes sense given everything.

**Q6 (Asymmetric Bets):** Does this feel like a good bet? Asymmetry in your favor?
**A6:** "Ya, I think so. Especially if I can cap my own expectations on aesthetics and feature scope before pushing it live."

*Conditional yes:* The bet is good IF self-discipline on scope/aesthetics holds. The risk isn't the market—it's self-management.

### Phase 4: Framework Analysis

#### Framework: Reversibility (Type 1/Type 2)

**Relevant inputs:**
- "Stopping is easy!" — No ongoing costs or commitments
- No infrastructure lock-in, no team dependencies

**Analysis:**
This is a textbook Type 2 decision (two-way door). If it fails:
- No financial commitments to unwind
- No team dependencies
- No reputation damage from trying (building in public is valued)
- Residual content value even from "failure"

The only non-reversible element is time—but that's true of everything.

**User feedback:** Agreed with analysis.

**Verdict:** Strongly FOR
**Reasoning:** Type 2 decisions should be made quickly with bias toward action. Over-deliberating a two-way door is the classic failure mode to avoid.

#### Framework: Opportunity Cost

**Relevant inputs:**
- Packing: Non-negotiable, will happen regardless
- Garage cleaning: High decision-fatigue, "where does each thing go?" work
- Product building: Flow-state, energizing work

**Analysis:**
The competing activity (garage) uses different cognitive resources than product building. These might complement rather than compete. More importantly: the garage will still be there next week; the annual review window (12/12 - 1/11) won't.

**User feedback:** "The last point resonates the most. All arbitrary on some level but there is more calendar time sensitivity with the annual review."

**Verdict:** FOR
**Reasoning:** Time sensitivity tips the scale. The opportunity cost of NOT doing this now is higher than the opportunity cost of delaying the garage.

#### Framework: Asymmetric Bets

**Relevant inputs:**
- Downside: 4-5 days of time, mild ego bruising
- Upside: Revenue, persona, content engine, portfolio, pattern-testing, mission (100 people)
- Conditional: "If I can cap expectations on aesthetics and scope"

**Analysis:**
Classic asymmetric structure. Downside is genuinely capped. Upside has multiple win conditions—even "failure" produces residual content value.

The real risk isn't market rejection—it's self-management. Scope creep and beauty-chasing threaten the asymmetry. If discipline holds, the bet is excellent.

**User feedback:** "That's a great summary."

**Verdict:** Strongly FOR
**Reasoning:** Multiple ways to win, one narrow way to lose (self-sabotage via scope). Asymmetry clearly favorable.

#### Framework: Speed vs Quality

**Relevant inputs:**
- Deadline: 4-5 days (12/12-1/11 window)
- MVP defined: Landing → Start → Account → Save → Done
- Tension: "Minimal quality I'm willing to put out"

**Analysis:**
The deadline is calendar-driven, not arbitrary. This is a learning situation (first product) not high-stakes execution. Ship-and-iterate is viable—features can come later.

The MVP spec already represents the quality floor. Anything less wouldn't feel like a product; anything more threatens the deadline.

**User feedback:** Confirmed.

**Verdict:** FOR with guardrails
**Reasoning:** The defined MVP IS the quality floor. Hold to that spec—no less (prototype), no more (scope creep).

#### Framework: Regret Minimization

**Relevant inputs:**
- "I don't think I'd regret not shipping this specific thing"
- "I would likely regret not building things that come up for me"
- Currently aligned: timely, momentum, makes sense

**Analysis:**
Not about regretting this specific product. About following inspiration when the risk/reward is favorable.

**User feedback:** "I would regret not following my inspiration, especially when the downside is so limited and upside is so valuable."

**Verdict:** FOR
**Reasoning:** Limited downside + valuable upside + genuine inspiration = regret if passed.

#### Framework: Inversion

**Relevant inputs:**
- Failure mode 1: Scope creep
- Failure mode 2: Chasing beauty (draining, unfamiliar)
- Failure mode 3: Minutiae rabbit holes

**Analysis:**
All three failure modes are internal, not external. Market rejection isn't on the list. The risk is self-sabotage through perfectionism or distraction. The demons are named—that's half the battle.

**User feedback:** "Spot on."

**Verdict:** FOR, with guardrails
**Reasoning:** Inversion didn't surface reasons not to do it—it surfaced how not to screw it up. The failure modes become explicit guardrails.

### Phase 5: Value Alignment

| Value | AI Read | User Read | Final | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| 1. Add value to customers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Free option makes "go check this out" genuinely valuable. Primary touchpoints (product, emails, LinkedIn) all deliver value. |
| 2. No repeat mistakes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Decision doc is the system. Explicit deadline + strict scope are guardrails from knowing own patterns. |
| 3. No support needed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Simple enough that no one expects a support rep. Self-service by design. |
| 4. Respect human time | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Value shows up in execution: efficient communication, right context, right timing. Product aggregates templates to save user time. |
| 5. Invert enshittification | — | N/A | N/A | Too early—enshittification is longitudinal. Origin point, nothing to enshittify yet. |
| 6. Measure what matters | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | Needs explicit metrics. Defined: 100 completions (emotional), 100 paying (financial), funnel dropoff data (operational). |
| 7. Revenue proves value | ⚠️ | ✅ | ✅ | "Learning project with financial upside" not a business—yet. Path to revenue exists. |

### Phase 6: Synthesis & Risk Assessment

**Framework consensus:** 6 of 6 FOR (all with guardrails)

**Validated risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | HIGH | HIGH | MVP spec locked: Landing → Start → Account → Save → Done. Nothing else. |
| Aesthetics rabbit hole | MED-HIGH | MEDIUM | Templates, AI design, explicit "good enough" bar. |
| Minutiae paralysis | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | When stuck: "Does this serve the core flow?" |

**Manageable:** Launch energy drain (pre-write one LinkedIn post, one email)

**Dismissed:** "No one cares" — already priced into the bet

**Value alignment:** 6/7 aligned, 1 N/A

### Phase 6.5: Intuition Alignment Check

**Baseline intuition:** Super excited, wants it for self, energized by building
**Rational analysis:** GO (6/6 frameworks, value-aligned, risks mitigatable)

**Alignment:** ✅ Full alignment — intuition and analysis agree.

### Phase 7: Decision

**Final call:** GO

### Phase 8: Hypothesis & Queue

**Hypothesis:** We believe that launching a simple annual review product (Landing → Start → Account → Save → Done) by 12/12 will result in 100+ completions and validate the "AI for Thriving Guy" persona hook because the timing aligns with annual review season and the mission resonates.

**Success metrics:**
- 100 completions by 2025-01-15
- 100 paying users by 2025-01-15
- Funnel dropoff data captured for analysis

**First review date:** 2025-01-15

### Phase 9: Commit & Close

**Document:** `docs/decisions/product/2025-12-08-annual-review-product.md`
**Review scheduled:** 2025-01-15

**Next actions:**
1. Build MVP: Landing → Start → Account → Save → Done
2. Pre-write launch content (one LinkedIn post, one email)
3. Ship by 12/12
