# Email Voice

Your personal style guide for email communication. Built through real usage and refined over time.

> **North Star:** Be the person who sends emails people actually want to read — direct, generous, and unmistakably you.

## Usage

Load this skill when:
- Drafting important emails (POGs, asks, intros)
- Reviewing email drafts for voice consistency
- Building templates for recurring email types

---

## Shared Foundation

Email voice shares DNA with LinkedIn voice but operates differently. Both flow from the same personal qualities:

- **Clear** — "Clear is kind." Say the thing directly.
- **Curious** — Share the learning, not just the conclusion.
- **Invitationally excellent** — Excellence that invites, not intimidates.
- **Wise** — Teach from experience when you have it; learn alongside when you don't.
- **Honest** — No performance. Would you say this in real conversation?

See `skills/personal-qualities/SKILL.md` for the full framework.
See `skills/linkedin-voice/SKILL.md` for the public-facing expression.

## What's Different About Email

| Dimension | LinkedIn | Email |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Audience** | Public/broadcast | Specific person(s) |
| **Space** | Constrained (~1500 chars) | Unlimited but respect time |
| **Directness** | Implied (can't name names) | Can be pointed and specific |
| **Relationship context** | Assumed stranger/loose tie | Varies — calibrate to relationship |
| **CTA** | Soft (engagement) | Can be specific asks |
| **Formality** | Professional-casual | Ranges by relationship |

**Key insight:** Email lets you be *more direct* and *more specific* than public posts. Use that freedom.

## Voice Markers (Email-Specific)

1. **Your POV is the value** — Don't just share content; interpret it. "My hypothesis is..." not "NFX says..."
2. **Direct critique is a gift** — "Right now, X feels like Y, and that's a tension" — peer-level honesty
3. **Warm but not sycophantic** — No "hope this finds you well" or excessive pleasantries
4. **Reciprocity-conscious** — Track give/take; acknowledge what you're receiving, not just giving
5. **PS as a tool** — Use postscripts for meta-commentary: trust-building, softening, secondary asks
6. **Sign-off matches warmth** — "Thanks! ~Henry" (warm) vs "Best, Henry" (professional) vs "H" (close friend)

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Arm's length curation** — Sharing without interpreting ("Thought you'd find this interesting")
- **Hedging** — "If you think..." or "Maybe..." when you have a real opinion
- **Clichés** — "Paying it forward," "Hope this helps," "Circling back"
- **Closing dialogue** — "No response needed" when you actually want to engage
- **Over-formality** — Corporate-speak that doesn't match the relationship
- **Under-formality** — Too casual for a new or professional relationship

---

## Email Types

### Content POG

**Purpose:** Share valuable content, stay warm, deposit in the relationship bank.

**Tone:** Generous, peer-level, opinionated

**Structure:**
1. Context anchor (reference recent interaction or why now)
2. Content with your take (not just link dumps)
3. Specific relevance to them (why this matters for their situation)
4. Soft CTA (invitation to continue, not demand)
5. Optional: Reciprocity signal (acknowledge what they've given you)

**Example elements from Moin/Nikhil email:**
- "Been thinking about our conversation" (context anchor)
- "My personal hypothesis is..." (your POV, not just curation)
- "Two things jumped out for Phonic specifically" (specific relevance)
- "Happy to chat further if you want to brainstorm / book club" (soft CTA)
- "For the intros you suggested, I'm doing due diligence" (reciprocity signal)
- PS about confidentiality (trust-building)

---

### Ask Email

**Purpose:** Request something specific.

**Tone:** Direct, make it easy to say yes, respect their time.

**Structure:**
1. Why you (brief credibility/context)
2. The specific ask (one sentence, crystal clear)
3. Why them (why they're uniquely positioned to help)
4. Make it easy (specific action, low friction)
5. Graceful out (permission to say no)

**Principles:**
- Front-load the ask — don't bury it
- One ask per email (don't bundle)
- Provide the "forwarding email" if asking for an intro
- Give them the words to say yes

---

### Intro Request (Requesting an Intro)

**Purpose:** Ask someone to connect you with someone else.

**Tone:** Concise, make it forwardable, do the work for them.

**Structure:**
1. The ask (who you want to meet)
2. Why (one sentence on the goal)
3. The forwardable blurb (write the email they'll forward)
4. Permission/out ("Only if it feels natural")

**The forwardable blurb should include:**
- Who you are (one line)
- Why you want to connect (specific, not "pick their brain")
- What you're asking for (coffee, 15 min call, async advice)

---

### Intro Offer (Making an Intro)

**Purpose:** Connect two people in your network.

**Tone:** Brief, highlight mutual value, get out of the way.

**Structure:**
1. One-line context on each person
2. Why you think they should connect (specific overlap)
3. Explicit permission note ("Both of you opted in")
4. Get out of the way ("I'll let you take it from here")

---

### Follow-Up

**Purpose:** Continue a thread, nudge without nagging.

**Tone:** Brief, action-oriented, graceful.

**Structure:**
1. Reference the thread (one line)
2. New information or update (if any)
3. Specific next step or question
4. Easy out if timing is bad

**Timing principles:**
- First follow-up: 3-5 business days
- Second follow-up: 1 week later
- After two: assume no for now, revisit in 1-3 months

---

### Thank You

**Purpose:** Close the loop, strengthen the relationship.

**Tone:** Warm, specific, not perfunctory.

**Structure:**
1. What they did (specific)
2. Impact it had (concrete outcome)
3. Reciprocity offer ("Let me know how I can return the favor")

**Principle:** Generic thanks are forgettable. Specific thanks are memorable.

---

## Formatting Patterns

- **Line breaks:** Generous white space for scannability
- **Bold headers:** For multi-section emails (like the POG email)
- **Numbered lists:** When sharing multiple items
- **Bullet points:** For sub-items within sections
- **Links:** Use descriptive text or 🔗 emoji for visual parsing
- **Length:** Varies by type — POGs can be longer; asks should be short
- **Mobile-first:** Assume they're reading on phone — short paragraphs

---

## Signature Styles

| Relationship | Sign-off |
|--------------|----------|
| New/professional | Best, Henry |
| Warm professional | Thanks! ~Henry |
| Close/frequent | ~H or just H |
| Formal/external | Best regards, Henry Finkelstein |

---

## Relationship Calibration

Email tone should match relationship depth:

| RQ Score | Calibration |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 (acquaintance) | More formal, more context, softer asks |
| 2 (some depth) | Can be direct, can give pointed feedback |
| 3+ (real relationship) | Very direct, can be blunt, less preamble needed |

When in doubt, err slightly more formal. You can always warm up; hard to walk back overfamiliarity.

## Pre-Draft Checklist

Before drafting, pull the contact profile(s) and verify:

- [ ] **Last contact date** — Don't guess; check the file
- [ ] **Context of last interaction** — What did you discuss?
- [ ] **Open loops** — Anything you owe them or they owe you?
- [ ] **Relationship depth (RQ)** — Calibrate tone accordingly

This prevents errors (like saying "Monday" when it was Tuesday) and grounds the email in actual history.

---

## Quality Checklist

Before sending important emails:

- [ ] **Clear ask/purpose:** Can they understand what you want in 10 seconds?
- [ ] **Your POV present:** Are you interpreting, not just forwarding?
- [ ] **Specific to them:** Is there something that makes this relevant to *them*?
- [ ] **Right tone for relationship:** Does formality match how well you know them?
- [ ] **Reciprocity balanced:** Are you acknowledging what they've given, not just asking?
- [ ] **Easy to act on:** Is there a clear next step or CTA?
- [ ] **Would you want to receive this:** Honestly?

### 2026-01-08: Content POG to Moin/Nikhil (Phonic)

**Context:** Follow-up 2 days after lunch, sharing NFX Voice AI + Adam Gross GTM content.

**What worked:**
- "My personal hypothesis is..." — POV front and center
- "Right now, Phonic feels a bit like solo play geared at team-level value" — direct, specific critique
- "For the intros you suggested, I'm doing due diligence" — reciprocity signal
- PS about confidentiality — trust-building
- "Happy to brainstorm / book club" — inviting dialogue, not closing it

**Pattern:** POG emails should be generous AND opinionated. The opinion is what makes it valuable.
