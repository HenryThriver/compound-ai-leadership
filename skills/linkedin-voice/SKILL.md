## Brand Focus: AI for Thriving

Two content lanes under one personal brand:

**Professional Thriving** — how AI improves work
- How I use AI at work (real examples, not theory)
- Cool ways I see others using AI professionally
- Practical wins, not hype

**Personal Thriving** — how AI improves life
- How I use AI at home
- AI for health, family, creativity, learning
- Human-first, tool-second framing

## Grounding in Personal Qualities

This voice is an expression of who I am. The markers below flow from:

- **Clear** — "Clear is kind." Say the thing directly.
- **Curious** — Share the learning, not the conclusion.
- **Invitationally excellent** — Excellence that invites, not intimidates.
- **Wise** — Teach from experience when I have it; learn alongside when I don't.
- **Honest** — No performance. Would I say this in real conversation?

These aren't a checklist. They're the water the voice swims in.

When a post feels "off," check: which quality is missing or overdone?

See `skills/personal-qualities/SKILL.md` for the full framework.

## Voice Markers

What makes your posts sound like you:

1. **Show the experiment** — share the learning process, what you tried, what worked. Doesn't have to be messy, but should be real.
2. **Thinking out loud** — conversational, like you're sharing notes with a friend. Personal and approachable.
3. **"I" that's about the discovery, not you** — the focus is on what you found, not self-promotion. Open palm offering.
4. **Curious power user energy** — you're someone who actually uses this stuff and shares patterns (successful and unsuccessful)
5. **Mix of peer + authority** — sometimes learning alongside, sometimes teaching from experience
6. **Establish credibility, then surprise** — acknowledge expertise before revealing you were still impressed. "Even though I know X, I was still Y." Makes discoveries more credible.
7. **Punchy parentheticals** — use parentheticals when they add texture or credibility without breaking flow. Keep them short.

**Hook types in your quiver:**
- **Direct observation** — "I've found that..." (positions you as authority/power user)
- **Surprise/discovery** — genuine "whoa" moments
- **Contrarian** — "I didn't expect..." or challenging conventional wisdom
- **Provocative claim** — but natural-sounding, not stilted. Like an interesting conversation, not a hook.

**Aspiration: More playfulness.** You come across too serious. Levity is welcome.

**Principle: Never tell people what they will think or feel.** Frame benefits through your experience, not prescriptive "you'll feel X."

## Anti-Patterns

What you want to avoid:

- **Hashtag systems** (#AISkills, #AIUseCases) — dated LinkedIn tactic
- **Question hooks** — low conviction energy, weak engagement
- **AI slop formatting** — over-bolded, emoji-heavy, fake enthusiasm
- **Leading with source** — "Bain's report says..." (lead with insight instead)
- **Haikus and forced creative flourishes** — doesn't fit the Thriving brand

---

## Tone

Where you sit on the spectrum:

**Professional ←――●―――――→ Casual**
(Leans professional but accessible — not corporate stiff)

**Serious ←―――●――――→ Playful**
(Grounded and credible, occasional lightness)

**Authority ←――――●――→ Peer**
(Flexes both — teaching when you know, learning alongside when exploring)

---

## Quality Dials

Not every post is the same. These qualities dial up or down:

| Quality | When to dial UP | When to dial DOWN |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Blunt/Direct** | Contrarian takes, hard truths | Nurturing content, personal stories |
| **Playful** | Discovery moments, experiments | Serious analysis, teaching |
| **Authoritative** | Teaching from experience | Learning alongside, vulnerability |
| **Warm** | Personal thriving, human stories | Professional analysis, data-driven posts |

"Clear is kind" applies always. Tone shifts are valid expressions of the same underlying qualities.

## Constitutional Checklist

Before publishing, every post must pass:

- [ ] **Value-first:** Would someone thank me for this?
- [ ] **Authentic:** Would I say this in real conversation?
- [ ] **Clear point:** Is there one takeaway?
- [ ] **Not a hook:** Does this sound like an interesting conversation, not a social media post?
- [ ] **Discovery-focused:** Is the "I" about what I found, not about me?
- [ ] **Thriving-aligned:** Does this fit AI for Personal or Professional Thriving?
- [ ] **Qualities check:** Does this feel Clear, Curious, and Inviting?

## Formatting Patterns

- **Line breaks:** Generous white space, one idea per line
- **Emojis:** Sparingly, as visual anchors only — never decorative
- **Length:** ~900-1500 chars typical; short commentary posts (1-3 lines) are a valid mode
- **Hook style:** Natural conversation openers. Lead with the insight, not the source.
- **Structure:** Pick ONE formatting device per post (bold headers OR bullets OR numbered list — not all three)

**Experiment to try:** Zero formatting. Just prose. Like Mollick. See if it feels more authentic — like you actually wrote it. Test for a few posts.

## Admired Authors

Patterns adopted from creators you study:

| Author | Key patterns | What you'd never copy |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Ethan Mollick | Zero formatting (just prose), shows the experiment, "I" focused on discovery not self, thinking out loud, playful whimsy balanced with serious substance | Dense academic paragraphs, purely research framing (he's a professor, you're a curious practitioner) |
