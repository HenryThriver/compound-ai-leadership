# Decision Frameworks

This skill provides mental models for recurring decision types. It should be invoked when:
- Facing a decision that matches a known pattern
- Needing structure for complex tradeoffs
- Teaching decision-making approach to others
- Reviewing past decisions for framework fit

## Usage

When a decision is being discussed, identify which framework(s) apply and use them to structure the analysis. Multiple frameworks can apply to the same decision.

## Core Frameworks

### Reversible vs Irreversible (Type 1 / Type 2)

**Origin:** Bezos shareholder letters

**The Model:**
- **Type 1 (Irreversible):** One-way doors. Hard or impossible to reverse. Require careful deliberation.
- **Type 2 (Reversible):** Two-way doors. Can be reversed if wrong. Should be made quickly by individuals or small groups.

**Application:**
1. Classify the decision: Can we undo this easily?
2. If Type 2: Make it fast, learn from results
3. If Type 1: Invest in thorough analysis
4. Watch for Type 2 decisions being treated as Type 1 (common failure mode)

**Questions:**
- What would it take to reverse this?
- What's the cost of reversal?
- Are we over-deliberating a two-way door?

**Red Flag:** Applying Type 1 process to Type 2 decisions creates organizational paralysis.

### Regret Minimization

**Origin:** Bezos (Amazon founding decision)

**The Model:**
Project yourself to age 80, looking back. Which choice minimizes regret?

**Application:**
1. Imagine yourself at end of life looking back
2. Which decision would you regret NOT making?
3. Failure of action often regretted more than failure of execution
4. Most useful for career/life decisions, not operational ones

**Questions:**
- At 80, will I regret not trying this?
- Will I regret not acting when I had the chance?
- Is fear of failure driving this decision?

**Best For:** Big bets, career moves, "should I start this?" decisions

### Second-Order Effects

**Origin:** General systems thinking

**The Model:**
Every action has consequences beyond the immediate effect. Map the cascade.

**Application:**
1. First-order: What happens immediately?
2. Second-order: What does that cause?
3. Third-order: And then what?
4. Look for feedback loops (positive and negative)

**Questions:**
- What will people do in response to this?
- How will incentives shift?
- What unintended consequences might emerge?
- Does this create a positive or negative flywheel?

**Example:**
- First-order: We raise prices → Revenue increases
- Second-order: Some customers churn → We learn who values us most
- Third-order: Remaining customers may attract similar customers → Better product-market fit

### Opportunity Cost

**Origin:** Economics fundamentals

**The Model:**
Every choice forecloses other choices. The cost isn't just the resources spent—it's what else those resources could have done.

**Application:**
1. What are we NOT doing by doing this?
2. What's the next-best alternative?
3. Is this the highest-value use of our time/money/attention?

**Questions:**
- What else could we do with these resources?
- If we do this, what won't get done?
- Is this the bottleneck worth solving?

**Red Flag:** Evaluating decisions in isolation without considering alternatives.

---

### Asymmetric Bets

**Origin:** Taleb, venture thinking

**The Model:**
Seek decisions where downside is limited and capped, but upside is unlimited or very large.

**Application:**
1. What's the worst case? Can we survive it?
2. What's the best case? How big could it be?
3. Is the expected value positive even if probability of success is low?

**Questions:**
- What do we lose if this fails completely?
- What do we gain if this succeeds wildly?
- Is the ratio asymmetric in our favor?

**Best For:** Experiments, new products, speculative investments

---

### Inversion

**Origin:** Charlie Munger

**The Model:**
Instead of asking "how do I succeed?", ask "how would I fail?" Then avoid those things.

**Application:**
1. Define what failure looks like
2. List all the ways to achieve that failure
3. Invert: avoid those failure modes
4. Often clearer than directly optimizing for success

**Questions:**
- What would guarantee failure?
- What are we currently doing that's on that list?
- What's the stupidest thing we could do?

**Example:**
- Goal: Retain customers
- Inversion: How do we guarantee churn?
  - Ignore their problems
  - Make cancellation hard (builds resentment)
  - Never communicate
- Therefore: Do the opposite

---

### Speed vs Quality Tradeoff

**Origin:** Pragmatic engineering

**The Model:**
Most decisions have a right balance of speed and quality. Find it explicitly rather than defaulting.

**Application:**
1. What's the cost of being wrong?
2. What's the cost of being slow?
3. Can we get 80% of value with 20% of effort?
4. Is this a learning situation (favor speed) or execution situation (favor quality)?

**Questions:**
- How wrong can we afford to be?
- What's the cost of delay?
- Can we ship and iterate?

**Guideline:** Default to faster when reversible and learning; slower when irreversible and executing.

## Adding New Frameworks

When ingesting content that introduces a useful framework:
1. Document the model clearly
2. Specify when to apply it
3. List diagnostic questions
4. Provide examples
5. Note origin/source
6. Add to selection guide
