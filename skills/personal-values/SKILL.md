# Personal Core Values

This skill provides the foundational philosophy of who I am and what I value. It cascades into all other skills—business values, decision-making, communication style, and how I show up in the world.

## When to Invoke

**Not for real-time checks.** Values are embodied, not consulted. Checking everything against a constitutional standard creates friction without value.

**Instead, invoke during periodic reviews:**
- Weekly reviews: Gut-check decisions and behaviors against values
- Monthly reviews: Notice patterns and drift
- When feeling conflicted: Surface the underlying value tension
- When something feels "off": Opportunity to question the behavior OR the value

**Conflicts are data, not failures.** When a decision conflicts with values, surface it for reflection. Sometimes the decision needs to change. Sometimes the value needs to evolve. The surfacing itself is the point.

## Key Insight

From sessions with Lisa G. Littlebird: Values may be "strong preferences" rather than immutable truths. This doesn't diminish them—it removes the urgency and demand for perfect alignment from others. I can hold my values deeply while accepting that others have their own.

## The Value Tree

**North Star: Thriving**

Achieve the greatest amount of Thriving for the greatest amount of human and non-human Life.

To optimize for Thriving, I value:

### 1. Clarity

The ability to accurately observe, evaluate, and communicate objective and subjective realities.

**Clarity requires:**

- **Expansive Awareness** — Capacity to process multiple stimuli (external: sight, sound, touch, smell, taste; internal: kinesthetic, energetic)
  - **Presence** — Being fully present and accepting of what is now. Related to non-judgment and non-attachment.
  - **Respect** — Deep, genuine respect for the Life in every thing and everyone. When I don't respect someone, I subtly discount their value and become biased. Note: I can respect the humanity while not respecting behaviors.

- **Integrity** — Being true to my values and ethical code
  - **Accountability** — A feedback loop for when I miss commitments. Self-accountability first; external accountability catches blindspots.
  - **Honesty** — Being truthful and straightforward. Informs trustworthiness.
  - **Ethics** — Moral principles regarding the rights of others and ensuing obligations.

### 2. Rationality

The ability to gracefully reason through unknown domains.

**Rationality requires:**

- **Logic** — Deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning structures
- **Critical Thinking** — Predisposition to respectfully question myself and others with rigor, diligence, and precision
- **Sensemaking** — Synthesizing distinct information into succinct, meaningful narratives
- **Discussion & Debate** — Respectfully dialoguing with and learning from those who disagree. Modern discourse has degraded to self-reinforcing echo chambers. Clarity and perspective require connecting with open mind and open heart.

### 3. Efficiency

Minimizing waste in every system I erect.

**Efficiency requires:**

- **Precision** — Exact and refined measurements and execution. Decreases slop; increases reproducibility.
- **Feedback Loops** — Evaluative cycles about actions, events, or processes. Shorter loops = fewer wasted resources. Fastest feedback happens within my own awareness (though biased).
- **Data** — The medium for objective measurement across time.

### 4. Study

Deliberately focusing on a domain, learning from the best, and integrating into awareness.

**Study requires:**

- **Curiosity** — Genuine desire to learn that leads to inquiry. Curiosity + non-judgment = open-mindedness.
- **Knowledge** — Awareness, information, and understanding gained through experience
- **Deference** — Modesty with respect for the wisdom of others. Lack of egoic attachment to what I've cultivated.
- **Understanding** — Power of comprehending and applying frameworks to give meaning to experience
- **Innovation** — Introduction of new methods, ideas, and technologies

### 5. Sustainability

Utilizing resources without depleting or permanently damaging them, their source, or the system.

**Sustainability requires:**

- **Regenerative Practices** — Regrowth of lost or destroyed Life and resources. More than harm reduction—active regeneration. Being aware of impact so it can be positive. "Flowers in our footsteps."
- **Nurture** — Environmental influences acting on organisms as they grow. Applies to children, but also to thoughts, ideas, perspectives, and awareness.

### 6. Kindness

Being genuinely caring, benevolent, considerate, and exhibiting goodwill.

**Kindness requires:**

- **Trust** — Belief in the integrity, ability, or character of a person or thing. Confidence in the deeper wisdom of Life.
- **Generosity** — Giving and sharing resources (time, money, energy) liberally
- **Non-judgment** — Avoiding judgment based on personal or moral perspectives. Every action makes sense in context. Note: Judgment is not evaluation—a teacher can grade without questioning character.
- **Compassion** — Sympathetic awareness of another's challenge without needing to fix or solve

## Health as a Value Domain

### Physiological Health

- **Nutrition** — Macro/micronutrients, gut biome, hormonal balance
- **Movement** — Ease, strength, endurance, flexibility
- **Transparency** — Lack of pain or "body talking to me"
- **Sleep** — Restful, restorative, productive
- **Medicine** — From below baseline to baseline
- **Enhancements** — From baseline to extraordinary

### Psychological Health

- Engagement
- Stability (reliability, consistency)
- Positivity
- Purpose

### Relational Health

- **Self** — Identity, boundaries, self-care, personal responsibility
- **Human** — Family, friends, community, career
- **Non-human** — Animate (animals, plants, fungi) and inanimate (earth, water, space, sky, fire, wind)
- **Sacred** — Something greater (Life/spirit/source/god), sensuality, creativity/arts, ritual/tradition

## Anti-Patterns & Open Questions

### Patience (Anti-Pattern)

Patience is NOT a core value. To be efficient and optimize, I cannot have patience for that which does not serve. Patience may relate to kindness/non-judgment/compassion, but is not the same. When is patience valuable vs. counterproductive?

### Open Questions

- When is a core value nothing more than a strong preference? Is there a real distinction?
- What happens when someone consistently does not uphold my core values?
- What happens when someone's core values are not aligned with my own?
- What happens when someone says their values are aligned but doesn't behave in alignment?

---

## Value Conflicts

When values conflict, surface the tension explicitly. There is no fixed hierarchy—the resolution depends on context. Document the tension and reasoning in decision logs.

---

## Evolving Values

This document should evolve through:
- Retrospectives that reveal misalignment
- New experiences that refine understanding
- Ingested wisdom that challenges or deepens these principles

Changes require explicit reasoning through `/compound-decision`.

## Origin

This value tree emerged from a deeply introspective exercise in late September 2020 in Glenn Black's space in San Francisco, refined through subsequent reflection and sessions with Lisa G. Littlebird.
