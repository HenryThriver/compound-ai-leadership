# Relationship Building

CLI workflows for systematic relationship building. Testing ground for CultivateHQ patterns.

## When to Invoke

- After networking interactions (capture while fresh)
- Before meetings (prep and research)
- During relationship sessions (work the queue)
- When intro offers come in (log open loops)

## Core Philosophy

From CultivateHQ and Ferrazzi's principles:

1. **Generosity first.** Lead with value, not asks.
2. **Close loops.** Follow through compounds trust.
3. **Compound context.** Every interaction feeds future preparation.
4. **Systematic, not transactional.** Relationships are investments, not transactions.
5. **Personalized > generic.** "Here's a link" is noise. "Here's why this matters to *you*" is a POG.

### Content POG Principle

People are overrun with content. A high-quality content POG includes:
- **The link** (obvious)
- **Specific highlights** (lines, ideas that stood out)
- **Why it's relevant to them** (connect to their situation, interests, goals)
- **Optional: action items** (what they might do with this)

Pull from Readwise highlights when available. The commentary is the value, not the link.

## Key Workflows

### 1. Capture Interaction (Most Common)
After any networking touch:
- Who, when, where, context
- Key topics discussed
- Intro offers (either direction) → open loops
- Follow-up commitments → open loops
- Update RQ score if warranted

### 2. Prep for Connection
Before meeting someone:
- Review their baseball card (or create one)
- Check open loops with them
- Identify POG opportunities
- Prepare questions/topics

### 3. Relationship Session
Blocked time for relationship work:
- Review open loops (due this week)
- Send queued POGs
- Research new targets
- Update contact index

## RQ Score Reference (Ferrazzi Greenlight)

| Score | Label | Definition |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **5** | **Ambassador** | Long-term friend that actively advocates and supports each other's success |
| **4** | **Close Contact** | Intimate personal and professional relationship, worked well together over time |
| **3** | **Recurring Contact** | Familiar relationship with recurring contact and some value exchange |
| **2** | **Connected** | One dedicated conversation/meeting, they know each other's role professionally |
| **1** | **Aware** | Early awareness and communication exist, but no meeting or relationship |
| **0** | **Unaware** | No communication or response, not on their radar (target list) |
| **-1** | **Strained** | An unresolved issue is negatively impacting ability to work together |

## Loop Lifecycle

```
Queued → Active → Pending → Closed
```

- **Queued:** Identified, not yet acted on
- **Active:** In progress, ball in someone's court
- **Pending:** Waiting on response/outcome
- **Closed:** Complete, outcome recorded

## Evolution

This skill evolves through use. Patterns that work get documented. Friction points get smoothed.
