## Voice AI & AI Strategy

### Voice as Wedge, Not Product

Voice AI will commoditize as a standalone product. The real opportunity is using voice as a wedge into workflows, data, and platform expansion. Founders should ask: "Is voice your core product, or your wedge to gain traction before expanding?"

> "Is voice your core product and primary value proposition? Or is it your wedge to gain initial traction before expanding into a broader platform?"

### Four On-Ramps for Voice AI Companies

NFX identifies four entry points for voice AI startups:

1. **AI as Labor** — Call center replacement, sales automation. Clear ROI, high competition.
2. **Voice as Wedge** — Enter narrow, expand broad. Voice as trojan horse for platform.
3. **Conversational Data Goldmine** — Voice unlocks qualitative data at scale. People share more in conversation.
4. **Voice with Soul** — Emotional intelligence, delight over efficiency. Therapy, education, companionship.

### The Wedge Strategy (4 Steps)

1. Enter with a voice AI solution that solves a specific, high-value pain point
2. Demonstrate exceptional ROI in this narrow application
3. Use established relationship and data insights to expand into adjacent use cases
4. Eventually become core AI infrastructure for entire business functions

> "The most successful companies in this space may use voice as the entry point to become workflow automation companies, data analytics providers, full-stack customer engagement platforms or all the above."

### Vertical Evaluation Rubric (5 Criteria)

When evaluating vertical opportunities for voice AI:

1. **High communication intensity** — Verbal exchange is primary value delivery
2. **Information asymmetry** — Expert knowledge hard to access without conversation
3. **Emotional context matters** — Tone, emphasis, pacing carry information
4. **Repetitive but nuanced** — Patterns exist but context required
5. **High cost of human labor** — Premium rates or high volume needed

## Data & Network Effects

### Real-Time Data as Sustainable Network Effect

> "Real time data is uniquely valuable. In fact, we believe it is the only type of data we've seen that is capable of sustaining a network effect."

Voice enables qualitative data collection at scale that was never before possible. This creates opportunities for conversational interfaces that gather better information in real time.

## Market Timing

### Why Voice AI Now (Late 2024 Inflection)

Three breakthroughs converged:

1. **Model Quality & Latency** — Sub-300ms round-trip, API-accessible
2. **LLM Integration** — Plug-and-play reasoning via GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3. **Dramatically Reduced Costs** — Quality voice services at pennies per minute

> "Like the early days of mobile apps or web applications, we're about to see an explosion of experimentation."
