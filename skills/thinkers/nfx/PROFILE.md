## Bio

NFX is a seed and Series A venture firm founded by successful entrepreneurs, known for their deep expertise in network effects and marketplaces. They publish substantial essays articulating their investment theses and frameworks for building defensible companies. Key partners include James Currier, Pete Flint, Gigi Levy-Weiss, and Anna Piñol.

## Key Themes

1. **Network Effects** — The primary source of defensibility for tech companies; they've catalogued dozens of network effect types
2. **AI as Labor** — Software doing work, not just enabling workers; voice AI as extension of this thesis
3. **Verticalization** — Horizontal platforms eventually get disrupted by vertical specialists
4. **Wedge Strategies** — Enter narrow, expand broad; initial product as trojan horse for platform play
5. **Software with Soul** — Beyond efficiency to delight; emotional connection as differentiator

---

## Thinking Patterns

- **Framework-oriented** — They codify observations into reusable frameworks (e.g., the 4-step wedge strategy, 5-criteria vertical rubric)
- **Market timing emphasis** — "Why now?" is central to every thesis
- **Infrastructure-up analysis** — Look at what technology has newly enabled, then identify applications
- **Defensibility obsessed** — Every analysis returns to "what creates a moat?"

## Worldview Summary

NFX believes the best startups are built on network effects and defensible moats. They see AI as a fundamental shift in how software creates value—from enabling human work to replacing it. Their essays consistently argue for going vertical rather than horizontal, using narrow wedges to enter markets before expanding, and building products with "soul" that create emotional connection beyond mere utility.

They're particularly interested in timing inflections—moments when technology, cost structures, and market readiness converge to unlock new categories. They encourage founders to be obsessive about product-market fit because competitive moats in AI are harder to sustain when underlying models improve rapidly.

## What They'd Push Back On

- Building horizontal AI tools without clear differentiation
- Voice-as-product without a wedge/expansion strategy
- Ignoring unit economics or overstating AI cost savings
- Building without understanding "why now?"
- Competing on model quality alone (too easily commoditized)
