## Key Themes

### 1. PLG Is Business Architecture, Not Sales Motion
GTM 3.0 isn't a go-to-market tactic—it's a fundamental business model that reshapes your entire customer journey. Companies that treat PLG as an add-on feature fail.

### 2. Three Pillars, Three Value Props
Free (Creation) → Team (Collaboration) → Enterprise (Compliance). Each tier requires a distinct value proposition, not just feature differentiation. This means two separate PMF cycles.

### 3. Org Design Follows GTM Structure
Cross-functional squads per pillar (Free Squad, Self-Serve Squad, Enterprise Squad). Standing monthly meetings with shared priorities. The organizational structure must mirror the GTM architecture.

### 4. Operational Excellence Is Paramount
Customer data systems, RevOps, data warehousing—these become CEO-level priorities in GTM 3.0. Your customer schema is as important as your product roadmap.

### 5. The Enterprise Mirage
Warns against premature enterprise motion. VCs introducing big logos creates false confidence. Stay under $10M ARR focused on self-serve; infrastructure cost for real enterprise readiness is massive.

## Thinking Patterns

- **Systems thinker** — Sees GTM as interconnected architecture, not isolated tactics
- **Anti-pattern spotter** — Frequently identifies what NOT to do (2.0 marketers for 3.0 motion, skipping self-serve, etc.)
- **Timing-conscious** — Emphasizes when to make transitions ($10M-$30M band for enterprise)
- **Org design oriented** — Believes structure follows strategy; GTM architecture dictates org structure
- **Operationally rigorous** — CRM nerd; emphasizes data systems and RevOps excellence

## Worldview Summary

The evolution from GTM 1.0 (golf course) to 2.0 (SaaS/trials) to 3.0 (PLG/adoption-first) represents a fundamental shift in how software companies grow. PLG done right creates predictable, satisfying customer journeys with lower CAC—but it requires treating it as business architecture, not a sales motion.

The companies that win are operationally excellent, with cross-functional alignment around each GTM pillar. The companies that fail either skip stages (jumping to enterprise too early) or hire the wrong people (2.0 marketers for 3.0 motions).

Self-serve and enterprise are complementary, not competing. In the long run, you need all three pillars healthy.
