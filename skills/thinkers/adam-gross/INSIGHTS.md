## GTM 3.0 Framework

### PLG Is Business Architecture, Not Sales Motion

Go-to-market 3.0 is not a sales motion—it is a business model, a business architecture, and fundamental to your customer journey. The companies that fail at PLG usually try to treat it as an add-on feature rather than a fundamental business transformation.

> "PLG is not a sales motion. Go-to-market 3.0 is not a sales motion; it is a business model, it is a business architecture, and it is fundamental to your customer journey."

### The GTM Evolution

- **GTM 1.0:** The "Golf Course Era" — Selling to CIOs over lunch
- **GTM 2.0:** The "SaaS Era" — Online trials, SEM/SEO, inside sales
- **GTM 3.0:** The "PLG Era" — User-first, experience-driven, bottom-up adoption
- **GTM 4.0:** The "AI Era" — Just beginning (not yet detailed)

### Three Pillars, Three Value Props

Each tier requires a distinct value proposition—not just feature differentiation:

| Tier | Value Prop | GTM Motion | Key Metric |
|------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Free / Individual | Creation | Adoption | MAU |
| Team (self-serve) | Collaboration | Self-serve | MRR |
| Enterprise (C-level) | Compliance | Enterprise sales | ACV |

> "If you're just offering the same product, and this one has some modest differentiation from the free to team, you're going to have limited success in conversion. It has to be a distinct value proposition."

### Two PMF Cycles

The transition from Free→Team and Team→Enterprise represent two distinct product-market fit cycles.

> "What's most fascinating for me is looking at that nonlinear value proposition change as you go from free to team. When you have that, it's almost like there are two product-market fit or customer discovery cycles that need to happen."

## Timing & Transitions

### The $10M-$30M Enterprise Band

Don't begin thinking about enterprise until self-serve is at about $10M ARR. But if you're past $30M and haven't done it, that's suspicious.

> "I wouldn't even begin thinking about it until your self-serve business is at about 10 million ARR. So don't worry about it too early. But if you're up past 30, and you haven't done it, then I would be pretty suspicious."

When ready for enterprise, don't start with a Head of Sales—start with a solution-oriented rep comfortable helping CEO, product, and marketing discover the enterprise value proposition.

### The Enterprise Mirage

Startups fall into the "Enterprise Mirage" when VCs introduce big logos who will sign $100K "if you only do X, Y, and Z." They land a few big logos through heroic efforts but fail to build repeatable systems.

> "There's a little bit of what I call the Enterprise Mirage that startups often fall into because they can get this initial boost of Enterprise... Don't underestimate the cost and complexity of building everything you need for Enterprise."

## Org Design

### Cross-Functional Squads Per Pillar

Create standing monthly meetings across sales, marketing, and product—one for free, one for self-serve, one for enterprise. Each cross-functional team gets a common set of priorities and backlog items within their vertical.

> "So literally, the way I would run my business at Heroku or at Vimeo is I had a Free Squad, I had a self-served Squad, and I had an Enterprise Squad."

**Squad Playbook:**
1. Create squad teams around each pillar (Free, Team, Enterprise)
2. Include cross-functional representatives in each squad
3. Sync priorities quarterly while maintaining functional autonomy
4. Implement common reporting frameworks
5. Hold regular stakeholder meetings to maintain alignment

### Support + Sales Integration for Self-Serve

For self-serve, build integrated support and sales teams. The work is almost always technical and support in nature. Have support talk to both existing AND prospective customers.

> "I'm increasingly a fan of the idea of support again, especially for the products that we tend to work with as developer-facing companies, of having a combined support/sales organization for the self-serve tier."

This is why FDEs (Forward Deployed Engineers) are such a common emerging pattern—they can be the sales force until enterprise threshold.

## Anti-Patterns

### Hiring 2.0 Marketers for 3.0 Motion

A common anti-pattern: company looking to build self-serve hires people with "marketing" in their title who are classic 2.0 people. They start buying ads and doing gated content capture—completely opposite of 3.0.

> "Another super common anti-pattern is a developer-facing company looking to build a self-serve business, hires a bunch of people with marketing in their title, but it turns out that they're classic sales 2.0 dimension people."

- **GTM 2.0:** Lead capture, trial, sell
- **GTM 3.0:** Drive product adoption

### Skipping Self-Serve for Enterprise

Companies want to go to enterprise and skip self-serve. Result: selling via enterprise channels is very expensive. Deals under $40-50K annually should be self-serve deals.

> "The other thing I see happen as an anti-pattern is, companies really want to go to enterprise and they skip self-serve. What ends up happening is, you end up selling via enterprise channels, which is very expensive."

## Operational Excellence

### Customer Data Systems = CEO Priority

In GTM 3.0, operational excellence becomes paramount. To connect pillar 1 all the way to pillar 3, you need excellent customer data systems.

> "One thing I will implore you is in the 3.0 world, operational excellence becomes paramount... you need to be excellent at your customer data systems. I say this as a CRM nerd."

**Requirements:**
- Rock-solid customer data systems
- Sophisticated sales ops and RevOps
- Advanced operational data warehousing
- Modern customer data platforms

Your customer schema is as important as your product roadmap.

### Adoption > Conversion

The key measure becomes adoption, not conversion, not closing. Once you have adoption, you convert to department, then to enterprise.

> "So the key measure becomes adoption, not conversion, not closing. Once we have that adoption, we convert to the department, and then we convert to ultimately the enterprise."
