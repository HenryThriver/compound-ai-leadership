# Voice AI — Insights

Accumulated knowledge about Voice AI, from multiple sources and thinkers.

## Strategy & Positioning

### Voice as Wedge > Voice as Product

Voice as a standalone product will commoditize quickly. The real opportunity is using voice as a wedge into broader SOPs, workflows, and data. Voice becomes an opportunity to more deeply understand customers AND the business—that's the play.

**Tags:** `strategy`, `positioning`

*Henry's take: I believe voice as a product won't do much in the very near future as it gets commoditized. It's only powerful as a wedge into broader SOPs and workflows.*

### The Wedge Strategy Framework

Four-step framework for using voice as a wedge:

1. Enter with a voice AI solution that solves a specific, high-value pain point
2. Demonstrate exceptional ROI in this narrow application
3. Use the established relationship and data insights to expand into adjacent use cases
4. Eventually, become the core AI infrastructure for entire business functions

Requires a clear "Act Two" plan from day one. The most successful companies may become workflow automation companies, data analytics providers, or full-stack customer engagement platforms.

*Henry's take: This is what I'm trying to do with the baseball card networking app and voice memos. As voice commoditizes, the data becomes incredibly useful in understanding SOPs and workflows across domains.*

## Evaluation Frameworks

### Vertical Opportunity Rubric

Five criteria for evaluating vertical opportunities in voice AI:

1. **High communication intensity** — Industries where verbal exchange is the primary mode of value delivery
2. **Information asymmetry** — Fields where experts have knowledge that's difficult to access without conversation
3. **Emotional context matters** — Domains where tone, emphasis, and pacing carry important information
4. **Repetitive but nuanced exchanges** — Interactions that follow patterns but require understanding of context
5. **High cost of human labor** — Areas where skilled communicators command premium rates, or high volume needed

**Thinker:** NFX (Anna Piñol)
**Tags:** `framework`, `evaluation`, `verticals`

*Henry's take: Great rubric for evaluating opportunities. Useful when speaking with people building vertical applications like Phonic.*

## Economics & Moats

### Unit Economics Misconception

The common pitch: "Replace a $40k/year call center agent with $4k/year software."

The reality: This ignores the implied cost of managing the AI agent. You now have different economics around evaluating, maintaining, and scaling the AI workflow. Still cheaper, but it's much more than just the marginal cost per minute.

**Thinker:** NFX (Anna Piñol) + Henry's commentary
**Tags:** `economics`, `gotcha`, `reality-check`

### Real-Time Data as Sustainable Network Effect

Real-time data is uniquely valuable—NFX believes it's the only type of data capable of sustaining a network effect. Voice enables new types of qualitative data collection at scale that we've never unlocked before.

**Source:** `docs/content/2026/01-07-nfx-voice-ai-is-working.md`
**Thinker:** NFX (Anna Piñol)
**Tags:** `data`, `moat`, `network-effects`

*Henry's take: Real-time signal and intelligence architecture is the future of go-to-market. The closer we get to real-time, the closer we get to hyper-relevant, hyper-personalized actionability. Difficult to architect, but hugely valuable.*

## Technical & UX

### Latency Threshold

The conversation experience has crossed a critical threshold:
- **Sub-300ms** — Feels genuinely human
- **1-2 seconds** — State of the art, indistinguishable from human (Henry's assessment)
- **2-3 seconds** — Tolerable but noticeable
- **>3 seconds** — Feels "too slow," user expectations violated

User expectations have fundamentally shifted. We expect voices to sound and feel human.
