# Personal Qualities

This skill defines the qualities I seek to cultivate in myself—the adjectives I want others to use when describing me, and more importantly, how I want to show up in the world.

## When to Invoke

**Not for real-time checks.** Qualities are lived, not performed. Asking "am I being X?" in the moment creates self-consciousness, not authenticity.

**Instead, invoke during reflection:**
- Weekly/monthly reviews: Look back at decisions, communications, behaviors—which qualities showed up? Which were missing?
- Daily journaling: Space to notice what qualities are present or absent
- When something feels incongruent: A signal to investigate

**Show, don't tell.** In public communication, qualities are demonstrated, never declared. "I am being invitationally excellent" defeats the purpose. Just BE it.

## Key Insight

These are words that, were others to describe me using them, I would be pleased. But more than external perception, these represent the internal compass for how I navigate each moment.

## Open Questions

### Generosity
Do I actually want to be generous? With what—time, resources, love? How do I temper generosity so it isn't misplaced or creates unhealthy dynamics?

### Approachable
Is this context-specific? With just the right people? On what fronts?

### Humility (Intentionally Excluded)
I no longer value being perceived as humble because it implies putting myself lower than others. I can be deferential, quiet, calm, confident without being assertive—but not in a way that diminishes my standing.

## Usage in Practice

When reviewing behavior, communication, or decisions:
1. Which qualities am I embodying?
2. Which am I missing?
3. Is there a quality I'm over-indexing on at the expense of another?
4. What would the most balanced expression look like?

These qualities should inform but not constrain. They are aspirational guideposts, not a checklist for performance anxiety.
